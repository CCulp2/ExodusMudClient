One kind is\r\na 'coder' Immortal who has been created in order to test new code.  The other\r\nkind is an Admin immortal.  Admins can be regular immortals whose sole job is\r\nto help newbies and answer questions or they may have more specialized roles\r\nsuch as being in charge of Clans, Questing or Law.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a coder Immortal or one of the Admin persuasion, you are\r\nexpected to follow the guidelines found in 'help immortal laws' to the\r\nletter.  Additionally, there are a few pointers that need to be followed when\r\ndealing with the mortal population.\r\n\r\n  *  When speaking to mortals, ALWAYS try your very best to be 'visible' to\r\n  the mortals you are speaking to.  There may be instances when this isn't\r\n  possible for whatever reason, but those instances should be very rare.\r\n\r\n  *  As stated in 'help immortal laws' do NOT kill mortals under any\r\n  circumstances.  There may be a very rare instance where it is necessary to\r\n  slay a mortal for misbehavior, but again, this should be extremely rare.\r\n\r\n  *  It is very fun to play with mortals by switching into mobs.  Be very\r\n  prepared to wind up killing mortals if you play with them by switching into\r\n  naturally aggressive mobs.  Make no mistake -- if you are switched into an\r\n  aggressive mob, you WILL wind up killing a mortal at some point as you will\r\n  not have full control over that mob's actions.  (Read above point regarding\r\n  killing mortals).   Mortals do not like being killed by Immortals under any\r\n  reason, whether they are being played with or not, with the exception of\r\n  when quests are run.  So, if you want to have fun with them, the best way\r\n  to do this is to run a quest.  By doing this you cover yourself should a\r\n  mortal die and you make points with mortals because they like quests.\r\n\r\n  *  Roleplay is to be encouraged on Exodus, whether you are an Immortal\r\n  roleplaying or a mortal.  However, it has been found that Immortals\r\n  roleplaying a relationship with mortals tends to create a lot of confusion\r\n  on the MUD from a player standpoint and can even affect the Immortal\r\n  Staff as a whole in some rare instances.  For this reason please do not\r\n  roleplay relationships with mortals (which includes net sex).  You are more\r\n  than welcome to create a mortal character for this type of roleplay.\r\n\r\n  *  Coder Immortals, as stated above, are in existence to test code on the\r\n  live port.  As this is so, coder immortal interaction with the mortal\r\n  population on Exodus should be kept down to a bare minimum.  It is the job\r\n  of Admin Immortals to deal with the Exodus population in matters of helping\r\n  newbies, answering questions, running quests, making sure rules are\r\n  followed, and other related issues.\r\n\r\n  *  If a mortal writes to you specifically, please respond to them in a\r\n  prompt fashion if their note requires a response.  Not responding to\r\n  notes written specifically to you is a huge irritant to the mortal\r\n  population as a whole.  It's simply a matter of courtesy.  If you wrote to\r\n  them about a question or an important matter, you would expect a prompt\r\n  reply (if they were logged on).

This clan is for people who wish to lend a hand to new  players, and who wish to strive to do everything they can to raise the player base of\r\n\r\nthis game by being kind, considerate and helpful. If you join clan Advocation, the alt you join with can NEVER go PK again. You may leave the clan, but will be unable to convert to pk. With this\r\n\r\nmethod I hope to prevent people from joining for clan gear, and leaving to PK. The clan gear Advocation offers is the best because it's for players who will be risking their lives to help others \r\n\r\nequip, raid or get out  of a sticky situation, and will NEVER be used to get one up in PK. Because of this, any memer of clan Advocation is also banned from Battle Royales, Super Duels, and the\r\n\r\nArena. The portals in the clan hall are for getting to people in need FAST. They are not for helping someone PK in anyway. Lastly, being a part of clan Advocation means taking on an extra burdon.\r\n\r\nIt means not only must you answer anybody's call for help, no matter how stupid it may seem, as long as you have the Advocation clan symbol infront of your name, you help them. In addition to \r\n\r\nhelping mortals, you will be higher up the ranks for helping immortals come up with new ideas for quests, classes, races and anything else that might help the games progress.

True neutral is 0 alignment\r\n\r\nwith -1000 and 1000 being the opposite extremes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever you kill a monster, it affects your alignment.

In fact, if Bob killed nothing but snakes that had an\r\n\r\n   alignment of -25, eventually Bob's alignment would become 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is that a person who slays slightly evil monsters is not as holy as\r\n\r\none who fights extremely evil monsters.

The city \r\n\r\nof Thesden could barely withstand the fierce onslaught of forces far superior \r\n\r\nto the armies of the humans. \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nThe roads became unsafe.  All cities were surrounded and famine spread its \r\n\r\nevil arms, embracing the people in hopelessness and despair.  The `oKnights of the \r\n\r\nArgent Lance`h fought bravely together with the Thesden guards to drive out \r\n\r\nthe vicious hordes, but to little avail.\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nNo one knows where they came from.  Riding great warhorses and with lances bright \r\n\r\nand innumerable, a charge swept the outskirts of the city like a tidal wave, driving \r\n\r\naway the vro'aths and leaving destruction in its wake.  Many they were, noble \r\n\r\nwith grim faces from which the orcs ran away in terror.  They bore great silver \r\n\r\nshields and smote their enemy with the sheer power of their armor, their swords long \r\n\r\nand deadly with blinding rays from above. \r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nMany vro'aths fell during this first assault. The remaining few, not willing to \r\n\r\nwithdraw from their hated enemies, gathered round their banner of crimson red and \r\n\r\nwithstood their ground.  The echoes of battle rang far and away. \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nFilled with battle lust, the Argent Lance Knights`h exited the city on foot to fight \r\n\r\nthe remnants of the evil army together with these unknown holy warriors.  Together, \r\n\r\nthey drove the enemy away with great loss. \r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n`oThe Holy Alliant Order`h thus established themselves in Thesden, and from there, great \r\n\r\ncampaigns against the vroaths were planned.  Slowly the land was returned to \r\n\r\npeace, and trade began to flourish again. \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nIn Thesden, the White Tower was constructed to house the `oKnights of the Alliant order`h, \r\n\r\nwho swore alliance to the king.  Many youngsters applied as squires and apprentices \r\n\r\nin the hope of becoming paladins and priests.  The order grew at an impressive rate. \r\n\r\nNow... evil is spreading and the order is facing many struggles.  The King was \r\n\r\nassassinated and an impostor occupies his place.  The Order will not carry the will \r\n\r\nof the Assassin, so it faces prosecution.  Their friendship with the Argent Lance \r\n\r\nis broken, and many of their main members have been murdered.  Will the Holy Order find \r\n\r\nthe support of the `oAlmighty`h to derogate the king and defeat evil once again? \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n`c\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n-------------------------- \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nIt is required that all members adopt a last name and a shield-of-arms, to be \r\n\r\nsubmitted to the clan leader, as well as a detailed description.  A plan is also \r\n\r\nwelcomed. \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nThe RP is that of a Lawful Good.  PK is allowed, and even promoted, in case of evil \r\n\r\nclans or vroaths, our main enemies.  However, looting is not allowed, and a decent \r\n\r\nand chivalrous behavior is expected even when facing enemies \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nEven though the clan is lawful good, it may seem racist as they distrust elves \r\n\r\nand most sentient races.  Their religion is strict and monotheistic.  They \r\n\r\nrecognize an Almighty god.  All other gods are demons in the view of the RP. \r\n\r\nIt is expected of the clan members to help people in distress.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"174b5f6a-cb92-4065-82d5-409a966c63a5","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Alliant1 ","HelpText":"`nThe ancient and most noble order of the `oAlliant `n(meaning loyal) is\r\n\r\nnow resurrected.

They are not\r\n\r\nmade to engage in static combat like the Warrior, yet the Assassins have\r\n\r\nmanaged to acquire several techniques from those traditional classes to\r\n\r\nreplace the discarded skills they no longer have any use for.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nAssassins may seem similar to Thieves, and Thieves are the closest class to\r\n\r\nthem, but Assassins are pure killers, and as such possess only the skills\r\n\r\nof killing.  The primary attribute for the Assassin is dexterity.\r\n\r\nSpecialization has benefits, but also disadvantages.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of quick death on the move has no room for the use of some\r\n\r\ncumbersome equipment, which means that Assassins never use shields.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Assassins are all marked men and women.  If they show their\r\n\r\nfaces in public, they may be attacked on sight with no level restriction\r\n\r\nprotection and with no nonclan status protection either.  An Assassin must\r\n\r\nbe neutral or evil.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nSKILLS\r\n\r\nLevel  1: backstab, dagger\r\n\r\nLevel  3: flail\r\n\r\nLevel  4: dodge\r\n\r\nLevel  5: kick, sword, throwing\r\n\r\nLevel  6: staff\r\n\r\nLevel  7: mace\r\n\r\nLevel  8: sneak, stalk\r\n\r\nLevel  9: axe\r\n\r\nLevel 10: hide, fishing\r\n\r\nLevel 11: polearm\r\n\r\nLevel 12: blindfighting, trip\r\n\r\nLevel 15: elusiveness\r\n\r\nLevel 18: butcher\r\n\r\nLevel 20: conceal, enhanced damage\r\n\r\nLevel 21: assassinate\r\n\r\nLevel 22: swimming\r\n\r\nLevel 23: envenom\r\n\r\nLevel 25: track\r\n\r\nLevel 30: tripwire\r\n\r\n`a[Second Tier]`h\r\n\r\nLevel 31: riding\r\n\r\nLevel 32: hand to hand\r\n\r\nLevel 35: second attack\r\n\r\nLevel 38: critical strike\r\n\r\nLevel 40: sap\r\n\r\nLevel 43: sweep\r\n\r\nLevel 50: circle, mask\r\n\r\nLevel 60: kai\r\n\r\n`a[Third Tier]`h\r\n\r\nLevel 65: fisticuffery, wands\r\n\r\nLevel 75: dual wield\r\n\r\nLevel 80: entangle\r\n\r\nLevel 81: eviscerate\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"9851190f-bc58-4bbf-b3b9-0f7fc20a02cc","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"astral body ","HelpText":"Astral Body\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\nA simple chant that allows the necromancer to cloak his construct and\r\n\r\nhimself in the ether, hiding them from all but a magical sight.\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"1b2063d7-3aa9-4df9-b0b3-1ea9e67053a5","LevelAccess":93,"Keywords":"AT ","HelpText":"Syntax: at <location> <command>\r\n\r\nAt executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given\r\nlocation.

Great!  Building an area is something that\r\n\r\ncrosses everyone's mind at some point.  The trick is to figure out whether\r\n\r\nit's a whim or a real passion.  We see players as our guests and customers.\r\n\r\nPlayers are the reason we run this mud.  We look at builders as our\r\n\r\nemployees and we expect a level of performance out of them.  We have a\r\n\r\nspecial port for building, which is seperate from the live port that people\r\n\r\nplay on.  The builder's port is a lonely place unless you are busy working\r\n\r\non an area, so if you just want a character to hang out, you will be very\r\n\r\nunimpressed.  Also, we need someone who we know and trust, so you have to\r\n\r\nhave played this game for a while and built up a trust with the imms.  I\r\n\r\ncannot tell you how many people have walked into Exodus and asked if we're\r\n\r\nhiring builders.  The first question I always ask is \"Have you played here?\"\r\n\r\nIf you have not played on Exodus, how can you understand the theme of the\r\n\r\ngame and what kind of an area would be appropriate?  Also, you need to be a\r\n\r\nliterate speller and have decent grammar.  We don't expect everyone to hold\r\n\r\nan English degree, but Exodus prides itself in the richness of its\r\n\r\ndescriptions and we would like to keep up a standard.  Exodus has a great\r\n\r\nOLC, but there is still a teaching process involved and we don't want to waste\r\n\r\nour time teaching someone who will build for a week and then give it up.\r\n\r\nLastly and most importantly, we need to know you actually plan to build an\r\n\r\narea and not just study the game for your mortal alts on the live port.\r\n\r\nYou may laugh, but people have done this in the past and it amounts to\r\n\r\ncheating.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nIn order to be set up with an account on the builder's port, we need you to\r\n\r\ndo a little homework first.

As a result,\r\n            a conversion system has been created to get the old-style\r\n            players into the new-style system.\r\n\r\n            When you log in, you are moved to jail, but you are not being\r\n            punished.  We just need to get you out of circulation.  You\r\n            have all your equipment and all your public channels.  Also,\r\n            you will have easy access to food and water this way.  If you\r\n            want to stay under the old-style system and simply chat, you\r\n            may do so.  Or, if you wish to speak with an immortal before\r\n            going through conversion, you have that option as well.\r\n\r\n            If you do go through conversion, you will receive a lump sum\r\n            of experience for your old-style levels and skills.  The higher\r\n            your various skills were, the more exp you get for each of them.\r\n\r\n            The first thing to be aware of is that your stats have been\r\n            rerolled.  If you do not like your stats, you can reroll over\r\n            and over using the `kreroll`` command.  This command can only\r\n            be used at level 1, so once you advance, you're stuck with\r\n            your stats.\r\n\r\n            Your character will automatically have every skill and spell/\r\n            prayer/song/chant that your class can get at 1%.  There is no\r\n            longer any need to pick and choose.  Practice points are gone\r\n            and you will practice your skills by spending experience\r\n            points.\r\n\r\n            Training points are still here, although you can no longer\r\n            train hp/mana/move.  It's ok, though, because you can improve\r\n            them by spending exp as well, but you should not worry about\r\n            that right now.  At level 1, you have two training points.\r\n            Once you have a reroll that you like, spend you training points\r\n            on your stats.  Now you're ready to advance.\r\n\r\n            The cost of advancing rises steadily as you go up, so you should\r\n            check your total exp after every level advancement.  For each of\r\n            the first ten levels, you will get another training point to use\r\n            on your stats.  Use them as you go so you can take advantage of\r\n            their benefits right away.\r\n\r\n            It's important to take care when building your character because\r\n            if you spend too much exp on levels, you will not have as much\r\n            to spend on skills and spells.  Likewise, you should not rush\r\n            off and practice your skills and spells to 100% right away\r\n            because the cost of practicing rises steadily as well.\r\n\r\n            My suggestion would be to deal with advancing to level 10 first\r\n            and spend your training sessions along the way.  Once you are\r\n            at level 10, look at your skills and spells and start\r\n            practicing them.  they all start off very cheap and they all\r\n            end up very expensive.  Practice the ones you want to about 50%\r\n            and then check your exp to make sure you have enough.  You can\r\n            always top them off later.  After this, strike a balance\r\n            between advancing levels and practicing skills and spells.\r\n            You will notice that your final character will be nowhere near\r\n            as powerful as you were under the old system.  It's ok though,\r\n            because you will be more powerful than those who you were more\r\n            powerful than under the old system and there is so much more\r\n            possibility to grow now.\r\n\r\n`g:`e----------------------------------------------------------------------------`g:``\r\n`l[`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l]``\r\n`g:`e============================================================================`g:``\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"a1cf29ce-de72-4102-8e58-fe81c39d543e","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Convicted ","HelpText":"","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"df85e2a0-4e93-4d28-8260-733f4bbfbb2e","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Convicts ","HelpText":"`aClan convicts is for permanently (or near permanently) jailed characters.``\r\n\r\n`aOnly preconversion characters, or characters with over 1000 ticks of jail``\r\n\r\n`atime may apply.

He told Desrielle that it was her destiny to establish\r\n\r\na clan, the likes of which had never been seen in the land before.\r\n\r\nThis clan, he said, would exist for one purpose and objective only:\r\n\r\n                  to be silly.\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n    Almighty Biff saw, in his wisdom, that his children would need\r\n\r\nhelp accomplishing his desires for them... And so he told Desrielle\r\n\r\nthat the clan would require a few things of its members.  First, they\r\n\r\nmust generally, but not strictly, be evil, as morals are bad for\r\n\r\nserious silliness.  Second, they must be of a race capable of extreme\r\n\r\nsilliness - Sidhe, though mischievous, are too purely evil to pull\r\n\r\nthe kinds of pranks that require a group effort - they're simply too\r\n\r\nself-serving, Biff told her.  Vro'ath, though silly in their own right,\r\n\r\nare simply not intelligent enough to keep up with the demands of the\r\n\r\nmind that Clan Escargot would make of them.  And finally, Avatars,\r\n\r\nthough they can be intelligent and silly, cannot risk themselves in th\r\n\r\nways that true silliness requires.\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n    Biff also decreed that members of Clan Escargot should be\r\n\r\nappropriately accented in their speech at all times, and that they\r\n\r\nshould consider themselves at all times and in all ways exempt from\r\n\r\nthe laws of society, the government, fair play, and so forth.  The\r\n\r\nreason for this, of course, is that laws of any kind only hinder and\r\n\r\ndiscourage silliness.\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nRequirements for joinging Clan Escargot:\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nYou must be at least level 9 (duh.)\r\n\r\nYou must be Human, Elf, Syvin, Dwarf, Canthi, or Litan.\r\n\r\nYou may be of any class.\r\n\r\nYou must be silly!\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"c33947d7-e5a0-435a-9a7e-3ac2ba775e15","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"evil twin ","HelpText":"syntax: cast 'evil twin' <target player>\r\n\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"c5584bea-425e-466c-9e38-a806d518181c","LevelAccess":0,"Keywords":"EVOCATION ","HelpText":"Syntax: pray evocation <character>\r\n\r\nThe evocation prayer allows powerful clerics to summon forth players in\r\nany part of the world to them.

So it is suggested that\r\n\r\n         you not use an Avatar on Hell Night.\r\n\r\n`o\r\n\r\n`o\r\n\r\n         On Hell Night, all wishes are granted. But you do not \r\n\r\n         get to keep anything you recieve for free. The immortal\r\n\r\n         running Hell Night may or may not wish to also run quests\r\n\r\n         which will allow you to recieve benefits that will roll \r\n\r\n         over onto the active Exodus Port. All quests will and MUST\r\n\r\n         be altered in a way that will still post a challenge for\r\n\r\n         the players involved, since they will have unlimited access\r\n\r\n         to item editing's and enhancements. Immortals may also chose\r\n\r\n         to run quests, and not have the benefits roll over. If you\r\n\r\n         participate in a quest on Hell Night and get a prize, but \r\n\r\n         the prize is not awarded to your standard alt on the live\r\n\r\n         port of Exodus, please do not whine about it unless you \r\n\r\n         were told explicitly that the prize would be awarded to \r\n\r\n         your live alt. Doing such things will result in punishment.\r\n\r\n`o\r\n\r\n         If you ask an Immortal running Hell Night for any item in \r\n\r\n         the world, they must oblige. If asked, the Immortal hosting\r\n\r\n         Hell Night will also boost your Hit Points, Moves, and Mana.\r\n\r\n         They may or may NOT agree to edit an item for you.

In a perfect world, any race would be\r\n\r\nwelcome to join our clan, but as it is, we will not accept\r\n\r\nVro'ath or Sidhe in our clan to protect it from being twisted to\r\n\r\ntheir evil desires.  Clerics and Paladins will be scrutinized to\r\n\r\nmake sure they are not part of the power-grabbing establishment\r\n\r\nof the church.  Clerics and Paladins interested in Liberation\r\n\r\nTheology are welcome.\r\n\r\nDecisions in this clan will be made democratically by its\r\n\r\nmembers.  The clan leader will have no special duties or\r\n\r\npriveledges other than those of a beaurocratic nature.  If at any\r\n\r\ntime the members of clan Libertad wish to have a new leader\r\n\r\n(elected democratically, of course) the old leader must step down.\r\n\r\nAt first our activities will likely center on helping newcomers\r\n\r\nto Exodus become more skilled in order to reduce the power that\r\n\r\nothers can have over them.  When our members grow strong, we will\r\n\r\nbegin to fight more for our ideals and stand up to gross abuses\r\n\r\nof power, elitism, etc.\r\n\r\nSince slavery is such a terrible problem in Exodus, we will strive\r\n\r\nto fight it both directly and in more subtle ways.  For this reason\r\n\r\nwe are the sworn enemies of the Varruk clan.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nOOC NOTES:\r\n\r\nClerics and Paladins should have something meaningful about their\r\n\r\nrelationship to the church in Exodus in their plans to contribute\r\n\r\nto role-playing.  Vro'ath and Sidhe are not allowed because they\r\n\r\nsupposed to be evil.  Most members should be good, but neutral\r\n\r\nalignments will be tolerated as \"freedom-fighters\" often use\r\n\r\nmethods that are not very nice.  We'll try to stay away from PK\r\n\r\nfor a while, unless we are provoked.  Loners and clanned people\r\n\r\nwho attack our members should not be surprised if the favor is \r\n\r\nreturned, even if out of level.  In general, no member of Libertad\r\n\r\nshould ever PK without just provocation (i.e. in a clan war or to\r\n\r\na PK of one of our members).\r\n\r\nThis clan will try to concentrate on role-playing.  If you don't\r\n\r\ncare about role-playing, and just want to kill people, please\r\n\r\ndon't apply.

Combining this with setting the other clans against one\r\n\r\nanother it is hoped that these offensive tribal gangs might be\r\n\r\nextinguished.  The second goal, is much more insidious.  It is known\r\n\r\nthat Auvyron fled to the south, beyond the dwarven ranges to work his\r\n\r\nmagics.  Through theft of documents from the Council of Nine, Jhereg has\r\n\r\nlearned that the rift may still be openable, that artifacts of Auvyron\r\n\r\nmay still exist, and that the secrets of his work might be unconverable.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that by establishing a wide information network, and\r\n\r\nthrough carefully planned expeditions, Jhereg may discover Auvyron's\r\n\r\nlost tower and infiltrate it.  Post-discovery may lead to power, wealth,\r\n\r\nknowledge, and the means to eradicate the belief in Auvyron's philosophy\r\n\r\nfrom those still pledging allegiance to clan divergent.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n`b------------------------------------------------------------------------`h\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"ea1c8ae3-4f1a-44a9-8d80-94105d1080f1","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Jhereg ","HelpText":"`o*`b--------------------------------------------------`o*\r\n\r\n`a[`bClan Jhereg`a]`h\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n`a[`bRestrictions`a]`h\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n        `a[`bAdmission`a]`h\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n        `ko`o Sidhe Only\r\n\r\n        `ko`o Any Class\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n        `a[`bWar`a]`h\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n        `ko`o Extremely likely to initiate a war\r\n\r\n        `ko`o Loot if we want to\r\n\r\n        `ko`o Prisoner/EQ exchanges acceptable\r\n\r\n        `ko`o Will probably continue subtle hostilities after war\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n`b[`aRP History`b]\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n        `a[`bSidhe Background`a]`h\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n`oThe Sidhe are ancient race,, the eldest of the fey races.

Necromancers`h\r\n\r\n`aare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand`h\r\n\r\n`acombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer`h\r\n\r\n`aand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between`h\r\n\r\n`alife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to`h\r\n\r\n`aanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. `h\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`aNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and`h\r\n\r\n`arituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to`h\r\n\r\n`aperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a`h\r\n\r\n`afocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,`h\r\n\r\n`ahexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects`h\r\n\r\n`arespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer`h\r\n\r\n`athey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the`h\r\n\r\n`anecromancer's own blood to draw. `h\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`aUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which`h\r\n\r\n`atype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are`h\r\n\r\n`askeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a`h\r\n\r\n`anatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.`h\r\n\r\n`aWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come`h\r\n\r\n`afrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always`h\r\n\r\n`abeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a`h\r\n\r\n`aplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains`h\r\n\r\n`aand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that`h\r\n\r\n`aphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some`h\r\n\r\n`ainnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in`h\r\n\r\n`acombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty`h\r\n\r\n`aapparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark`h\r\n\r\n`ahood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be`h\r\n\r\n`aunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for`h\r\n\r\n`aa lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies`h\r\n\r\n`afrozen with fear.`h\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`h>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`aSKILLS``\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  1`a:`b dagger, staff`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  2`a:`b swimming`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  5`a:`b wands`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  6`a:`b staves`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 10`a:`b envenom`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 13`a:`b draw: pentagram`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 14`a:`b leeching`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 15`a:`b butcher`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 16`a:`b corpse carving`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 18`a:`b fishing`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 20`a:`b meditation`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 22`a:`b embalm`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 22`a:`b embalm`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 23`a:`b draw: hexagram`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 24`a:`b unsummon`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 25`a:`b sense death`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 30`a:`b riding`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 33`a:`b hellbreath`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 34`a:`b draw: death ward`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 40`a:`b feign death`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 47`a:`b corrupt`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 50`a:`b draw: septagram`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 52`a:`b feed death`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 60`a:`b feast`h\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`h>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`aCHANTS`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  1`a:`b lich eyes`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  5`a:`b astral body`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  7`a:`b nearsight`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h  8`a:`b pox`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 10`a:`b skeletal mutation`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 14`a:`b exoskeleton`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 15`a:`b knowledge of the dead, atrophy`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 17`a:`b festering boils`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 18`a:`b death vision`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 23`a:`b animate dead`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 26`a:`b corpse walk`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 27`a:`b intoxicate`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 28`a:`b calling`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 29`a:`b seizure`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 30`a:`b darkhounds`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 31`a:`b eldritch miasma`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 36`a:`b immunity`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 37`a:`b bone puppet`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 40`a:`b ghost form, bone craft`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 45`a:`b wind of death`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 46`a:`b drain aura`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 47`a:`b vomit`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 49`a:`b jinx, decay`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 50`a:`b unholy ceremony`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 51`a:`b demonic possession`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 55`a:`b brain blisters`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 60`a:`b clasp`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 62`a:`b death palm`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 66`a:`b vampirism`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 67`a:`b greymantle`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 75`a:`b bone hail`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 76`a:`b dark sphere`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 80`a:`b beacon of the damned`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 81`a:`b soul link`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 85`a:`b death shroud`h\r\n\r\n`aLevel`h 86`a:`b swell`h\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\n`h>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<``\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"388f63d1-429f-428f-ba34-28da6f237b18","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"KAAOSS1 ","HelpText":"`a|--------------------------------`c<`b+`a<==>`b+`c>`a--------------------------------|\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n                               `hCLAN MINIONS`a\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nLong before mortals, before Gods, before time...

They created the towns and the\r\n\r\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r\n\r\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r\n\r\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r\n\r\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r\n\r\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r\n\r\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r\n\r\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r\n\r\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r\n\r\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r\n\r\nwas restored to all its glory.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r\n\r\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r\n\r\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r\n\r\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or\r\n\r\nheard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Synn.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n`k\\`a-`h=`q$```h=`a-`k/ ``is the crown of Synn, to be worn only by the purest of evil.

As it has not yet been found, Clan Synn must search the world, trying to turn\r\n\r\neveryone they meet to evil, in hopes that they will find the one who is worthy to wear the crown.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nThe first to feel the power of the crown was Psylent. He tried to wear the crown, but was zapped\r\n\r\nby its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood and filth, weary\r\n\r\nbut still able to recal what had happened. On his hand was a burned engraved image of the crown. He\r\n\r\nwas shortly transported away, and back into Thesden. Later that night he neard a voice in dream.\r\n\r\nThe voice told him that he was given a gift. That he would be the one to find the true evil. The\r\n\r\nvoice told him to find others, and to kill all those who opposed him.

Litans in their home environment are nomads,\r\n\r\nliving in dynamic, socially ordered tribes with very little outside contact.\r\n\r\nTheir appearance is humanoid in general form, having four limbs and walking\r\n\r\nupright - but there the resemblance ends.  Their bodies are covered in dull\r\n\r\nscales, ranging in color from a light yellow, almost white, to a deep\r\n\r\nblack-red.  Their faces are featureless, smooth and rounded, with eyes like\r\n\r\ngleaming coal-black slits.  Their feet have three clawed toes, webbed to\r\n\r\nassist them in navigation of the sandy dunes.  Probably the most interesting\r\n\r\naspect of creatures is the slimy secretion that covers their scales.  This\r\n\r\nsubstance is highly flammable, and the Litans have developed a specialized\r\n\r\nmethod of utilizing it - two of their teeth are ridged, and can produce\r\n\r\nsparks if clicked together properly, sending the Litan up in flames.  It is\r\n\r\nan unnerving sight for those unaccustomed to Litans to see one in this\r\n\r\nstate.  They are, however, immune to heat and fire, and will never be\r\n\r\ndamaged by them, so to a Litan, setting oneself on fire is part and parcel\r\n\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nLitans are a proud race, temperamental and stubborn.  Their cultural\r\n\r\ntradition of tattooing their scales with flamelike and lightning patterns\r\n\r\nstems from the love of broadcasting their greatness to the world.  They\r\n\r\nboast and brag of their accomplishments and prowess to anyone near them - a\r\n\r\nhabit that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with those more powerful\r\n\r\nthan they.  In addition, they tend to be explosive and fiery, like the\r\n\r\nsubstance they secrete.  Unfortunately, not being the most intelligent\r\n\r\nbeings, they don't always make good judgements and sometimes end up dead for\r\n\r\nit.  Although Litans can form bonds of friendship, they generally have no\r\n\r\nfamilial ties or maternal instinct, and the concept of 'marriage' is a\r\n\r\nforeign one - mating is done easy-come, easy-go, generally when tribes meet\r\n\r\nin the desert, and they lay eggs deep underneath the sand.  Their eggs are\r\n\r\nfabled objects, being extremely hard to find and very beautiful.  Most are\r\n\r\nslightly incandescent, glowing softly from within, while the outer shell is\r\n\r\nanywhere from creamy off-white through yellow, red, and pitch black, some\r\n\r\nshaded and marbled beautifully. \r\n\r\nDue to a peculiar forked tongue and rigid palate, Litans are unable to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with other beings by normal means.  Instead, they use a\r\n\r\nhigh-pitched shriek, much like a shout, which can be heard from long\r\n\r\ndistances. \r\n\r\nStrength      `j****``........\r\n\r\nDexterity     `j*********``...\r\n\r\nConstitution  `j****``........\r\n\r\nIntelligence  ............\r\n\r\nWisdom        ............\r\n\r\nCharisma      ............\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLitans have natural immunity to fire.\r\n\r\nLitans have natural vulnerability to cold attacks.\r\n\r\nLitans takes additional damage in water.\r\n\r\nLitans are medium-sized.\r\n\r\nLitans regenerate faster near a fire.\r\n\r\nLitans are more nimble in sunny weather.\r\n\r\nLitans may set themselves on fire with the \"flame\" command.\r\n\r\nLitans may flare up to blind their opponents.\r\n\r\nLitans are unable to communicate as other races do.\r\n\r\nLitans may join the following guilds:\r\n\r\nWarrior, Paladin, Ranger, Cleric, Assassin, Thief, Reaver.\r\n\r\n`g:`e----------------------------------------------------------------------------`g:``\r\n\r\n`l[`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l]``\r\n\r\n`g:`e============================================================================`g:``\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"238c7b28-5df4-489a-8bcd-624b86996e79","LevelAccess":95,"Keywords":"LOAD ","HelpText":"Syntax: load mob <vnum>\r\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\r\n\r\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to\r\nduplicate strung items and mobs).

They created the towns and the\r\n\r\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r\n\r\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r\n\r\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r\n\r\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r\n\r\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r\n\r\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r\n\r\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r\n\r\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r\n\r\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r\n\r\nwas restored to all its glory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r\n\r\nthe relationship between Immortals and people.

At creation,\r\n\r\n   a character chooses a guild to follow.  For instance, a character named\r\n\r\n   Possum chooses to be a warrior at creation.  The character is then\r\n\r\n   considered a stage 1 warrior.  Any stage 1 guildmember has the ability\r\n\r\n   to learn any skills, spells, songs, prayers, or chants of that guild up\r\n\r\n   to level 30.  At level 31, Possum can either choose to continue to be a\r\n\r\n   more advanced warrior, or he can choose to become any other class his\r\n\r\n   race permits.  If he chooses to become an assassin, then he will be a\r\n\r\n   stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin and will be able to learn skills\r\n\r\n   up to level 30 in both guilds as his own level permits.  If he chooses\r\n\r\n   to remain a warrior at level 31, he will become a stage 2 warrior.  Any\r\n\r\n   stage 2 guildmember will be able to practice all stage 1 skills as well\r\n\r\n   as the more advanced stage 2 skills of that guild.  Upon reaching level\r\n\r\n   61, Possum will be given a third choice.  If he already chose to become\r\n\r\n   a stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin, he might also choose to\r\n\r\n   become a stage 1 thief.  He will be very well-rounded, but he will\r\n\r\n   possess none of the advanced skills of any of the guilds he is a member\r\n\r\n   of.  If Possum had previously chosen to become a stage 2 warrior and he\r\n\r\n   wishes to stay a warrior, he can become a stage 3 warrior.  As a stage\r\n\r\n   3 warrior, Possum will have access to the most advanced skills of the\r\n\r\n   warrior guild, as well as all stage 1 and stage 2 warrior skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Multiclass can seem a bit overwhelming, since there are over 100 paths\r\n\r\n   a character can take.  If you are daunted by the choices, just remember\r\n\r\n   you can always stay in your chosen guild and become a specialist and\r\n\r\n   you will not be any worse off for doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n`lRelated helps`h: [Help Class] [Help Remort]\r\n\r\n`g:`e----------------------------------------------------------------------------`g:``\r\n\r\n`l[`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l][`n\\`l][`n/`l]``\r\n\r\n`g:`e============================================================================`g:``\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"7e530ea1-29df-43ce-a5a0-a900357bd87d","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"MULTIKILLING MULTI 'MULTI-KILLING' 'MULTIPLE DEATHS' ","HelpText":"\r\nMULTIKILLING\r\n\r\nIn order to give player characters time to recover from being player-killed\r\n(PK'd), it is illegal to kill a player character a second time if they have\r\nnot had the time to completely heal from the wounds incurred from a death\r\nthat was directly caused by you.

Necromancers`h\r\n`aare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand`h\r\n`acombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer`h\r\n`aand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between`h\r\n`alife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to`h\r\n`aanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. `h\r\n`h\r\n`aNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and`h\r\n`arituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to`h\r\n`aperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a`h\r\n`afocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,`h\r\n`ahexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects`h\r\n`arespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer`h\r\n`athey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the`h\r\n`anecromancer's own blood to draw. `h\r\n`h\r\n`aUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which`h\r\n`atype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are`h\r\n`askeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a`h\r\n`anatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.`h\r\n`aWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come`h\r\n`afrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always`h\r\n`abeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a`h\r\n`aplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains`h\r\n`aand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that`h\r\n`aphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some`h\r\n`ainnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in`h\r\n`acombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.

One\r\nof the first projects that Hadukk organized was designed to improve the\r\ndefenses of the outpost.  He ordered walls be built at the north and\r\nsouth ends of the valley, which would effectively seal up Nre'yth since\r\nthe steep mountain slopes to the east and west were natural barriers.\r\nWhile Vro'ath are adept at constructing walls and other military\r\nfortifications, Hadukk still hired some dwarves for help, mainly to mine\r\nbuilding materials from the nearby mountains.\r\n\tAfter the completion of the walls, Hadukk felt secure enough to\r\nallow a civilian population inside Nre'yth, as long as the residents\r\nwould accept martial rule.  Indeed, Nre'yth became a key defensive\r\nstronghold for the Vro'ath.  With adequate supplies and soldiers, Hadukk\r\nfelt that the city could endure multi-year sieges.  Also, Nre'yth lies in\r\nthe way of one of the few routes for traveling to the northern parts of\r\nthe continent.  This allowed the Vro'ath city to dominate a key trade\r\nroute to the north.\r\n\tNaturally, the humans living to the south resented the Vro'ath\r\ncontrol of a key trade route to the north. Some hotheads organized a\r\nforce to seize Nre'yth.  Knowing that a direct assault upon the walls\r\nwould be futile, the humans bribed some dwarves for help.  These dwarves\r\nshowed the humans some passages through the mines in Aven Talir and Aven\r\nTeluk which were unknown to the Vro'ath.  Coming out of these mine\r\npassages, the human attackers were able to surprise the unprepared\r\nVro'ath garrison inside the city.\r\n\tThe humans nearly seized control of Nre'yth, if not for the\r\ndiscipline of the Vro'ath soldiers, which kept them from panicking, and\r\nthe foresight of Marshal Hadukk.  Knowing that Nre'yth was located in a\r\nstrategically important spot, Hadukk had predicted an attack on the city\r\nweeks in advance and had requested reinforcements from other Vro'ath\r\nleaders.  Led by Marshal Bujaghn, the reinforcements came in time to save\r\nthe city for the Vro'ath.  Unfortunately, Bujaghn was not in time to save\r\nhis colleague Hadukk, who was killed in a ferocious, almost suicidal,\r\ncharge by a band of human knights.  The arrival of Bujaghn's forces\r\nturned the tide, and almost all the human attackers were either killed or\r\ncaptured.  The few dwarven accomplices of the humans were also caught.\r\n\tAs punishment, Bujaghn put the human and dwarven captives to work\r\nin the mines. One of their first tasks was to collapse those passages\r\nwhich would undermine the defense of the city.  Furthermore, Bujaghn\r\ndecided that he would enslave these humans for the rest of their lives.\r\nAt this point, the Vro'ath religious leaders intervened. Such an act of\r\ncruelty would only reinforce the Vro'ath \"brute\" image that other races\r\nsaw.  The Vro'ath priests worked diligently to banish such an image from\r\neveryone's eyes. However, Bujaghn would not budge in his position; he\r\nfelt that slave was more than those human captives deserved. A compromise\r\nwas reached: Bujaghn would be allowed keep his slaves, but they were to\r\nbe well treated and released after serving faithfully for five years.\r\nHowever, Bujaghn negotiated a couple important concessions from the\r\nVro'ath church leaders. First, owners of slaves were allowed to sell\r\nslaves as property.  Second, all future prisoners captured in military\r\nencounters with the Vro'ath would also be subjected to slavery.  Thus,\r\nBujaghn can be considered the founder of the Vro'ath slave trade.  He\r\nalso organized the first slave raiding parties.  These were small bands\r\nof highly trained Vro'ath soldiers who attacked frontier human\r\nsettlements or groups of unsuspecting travelers, never with the intent to\r\nkill, but only to capture humans alive.  The Vro'ath religious leaders\r\ngrumbled a bit about this, but they grudgingly ignored these acts as long\r\nas the slaves were allowed to free after five years.\r\n\tAt present, Nre'yth is still primarily a trading city, with slaves\r\nbeing the major commodity.  Slave raiders still exist, but they now\r\ninclude other races as targets for slaves.  Rule in the city is a tenuous\r\nbalance of power between the leaders of the church and the military.  The\r\ncurrent leaders of Nre'yth are Marshal Torqenuk and High Priest il'Reshaz.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"bfd4c1ba-04ee-4efb-8dde-4c86e8428d7c","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"NWO ","HelpText":"The New World Order has arrived and they're here to win back control from the filthy non-humans.

We are\r\n\r\nthe ones who swim out just a little too far, not completely sure if we can\r\n\r\nmake it back to shore, yet somehow we do.  We watch the sharks, the orca, and\r\n\r\nthe giant squid from the safety of our ships' decks, knowing that, were we to\r\n\r\nfall overboard, the beasts would rip us apart.  For them, we have fear and\r\n\r\nrespect.  Fear and respect for the deep blue that stretches down further than\r\n\r\nthe mountains stretch up.  We long to uncover the mysteries that the `nsea`h hides\r\n\r\nfrom our eyes.  As we peer down into the cerulean depths, we dream of the\r\n\r\ntreasures and wrecks that may be resting on the bottom, perhaps forgotten for\r\n\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n`a*={=`b====-.`h\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n`hEarly in Thesden's history, a groups of wander-stricken adventurers set out to\r\n\r\nsee all there was to see of the world.  Initially conquering the lands around\r\n\r\nThesden, they explored to other towns, eventually wandering as far as their\r\n\r\nlegs could take them.  When they had seen as much as possible by way of land,\r\n\r\nthey bought what ships they could with their meager earnings and took to the\r\n\r\n`nsea`h.  Explorers by trade, they were not above doing whatever it took to come\r\n\r\nby the means to travel, including piracy.  Soon, these vagabond sailors had\r\n\r\nbanded together as a clan known as the Crimson Pirates.  As they mapped and\r\n\r\nconquered more of the world, they brought back treasures that made them\r\n\r\npowerful and wealthy.  No longer neding to steal and plunder, they kept their\r\n\r\nnamesake nonetheless as a symbol of pride.\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n`a*={=`b====-.`h\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n`hWe are a PK clan, but playerkilling is the choice of the individual.\r\n\r\nWe are a neutral clan, and sometimes allow good and evil players as well.\r\n\r\nWe are, by nature, `nsea`h-oriented, so you should incorporate it into your\r\n\r\ncharacter's description, plan, and home, or preferably, into your style of\r\n\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n``\r\n\r\n`hThe Pirates are not a very religous group, but months at sea can be humbling\r\n\r\nand a cause for fear, so as a result, a set of superstitions has developed,\r\n\r\nrevolving mostly around gifts or actions that would please `lUlimos`h, the\r\n\r\n`nCanthi `kGod `hof the `nSea`h.``\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"7b1974b4-85ef-41b4-8ae8-99473cfe1984","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"PLAGUE ","HelpText":"Syntax: pray 'plague' <target>\r\n\r\nThe plague prayer infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\r\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\r\ndeath.

The\r\n\r\nmost common information comes from the reptition of children's stories\r\n\r\nand bardic tales in remote areas of the world, such as the Teche Bayou\r\n\r\nand the Desert of Ath'Tanar.

Successful communication with\r\n\r\nelder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of\r\n\r\nknowledge of  `bWHY`o the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.

To go further\r\n\r\nand pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.

Just as the`a\r\n\r\n`hPaladin serves the forces of good in the world, the Reaver is the`a\r\n\r\n`hcounterpart, black-hearted swordsman.  The manifestation of the`a\r\n\r\n`hReavers faith is the blade they wield the symbol of their cult.  The`a\r\n\r\n`hReavers are based entirely around the blade, which is the only weapon`a\r\n\r\n`hthey are allowed to wield.  This blade has a mind of its own and is as`a\r\n\r\n`hmuch a part of the reaver as any other limb.  As the Reaver grows in`a\r\n\r\n`hpower, so does his blade.  By capturing the souls of the slain, a reaver`a\r\n\r\n`hmay feed the dark will of his blade and gain power through it.  Soul`a\r\n\r\n`henergies of the slain are sacrificed into the blade like a type of`a\r\n\r\n`hcurrency.  It is said that the developed blade in the hands of a skilled`a\r\n\r\n`hreaver is a potentially unlimited force.  Reavers may also store spells`a\r\n\r\n`hwithin the sword to be summoned forth at a time of their choosing.  A`a\r\n\r\n`hReaver who strays even slightly onto the realm of goodness is rebuked`a\r\n\r\n`hby his weapon, which abandons him until he returns to the path of`a\r\n\r\n`hdarkness.  Note: Reavers have special commands involving their swords. `a\r\n\r\n`h<sword options> shows what commands you may perform involving the sword. \r\n\r\n`a\r\n\r\n`hSome sword commands may be performed anywhere and some must be performed`a\r\n\r\n`hin the dark sanctuary of the Reaver guild hall.  All sword upgrades must be`a\r\n\r\n`hperformed in the dark sanctuary.  The same is true for all blade and burst`a\r\n\r\n`hspells, which can only be cast upon the sword at the altar of annihilation.`a\r\n\r\n`hOnce spells are stored in the sword, they may be invoked anywhere.  The`a\r\n\r\n`hduration of blade spells and the effect of burst spells is directly related`a\r\n\r\n`hto the alignment of the Reaver--the more evil the Reaver, the greater the`a\r\n\r\n`heffect.  When a Reaver dies, he must return to the dark altar in order to`a\r\n\r\n`hinvoke his sword again, although any spells and upgrades will stay in the`a\r\n\r\n`hsword.  Soul Energies (SE) are reaped from mobs based on their level and`a\r\n\r\n`halignment.  Angelic mobs and more powerful mobs will give more SE.  Reaver`a\r\n\r\n`hblades are open-ended, meaning there is no cap on the power one can imbue`a\r\n\r\n`hhis blade with, although the cost of upgrading the blade increases`a\r\n\r\n`hdramatically as the blade becomes more powerful.  Combat upgrades fall into`a\r\n\r\n`hfour categories: Power, Hatred, Fury, and Strength.  Raising the Power of`a\r\n\r\n`hyour blade will moderately increase the damage your blade can inflict,`a\r\n\r\n`halthough you may not notice right away.  Hatred is a more dramatic and`a\r\n\r\n`hobvious upgrade, but it is also more expensive.  Fury refers to the vigor`a\r\n\r\n`hwith which the Reaver attacks the target.  Improving Fury will give you a`a\r\n\r\n`hbetter chance of hitting your opponent.  Blade Strength is another aspect`a\r\n\r\n`hwhich determines the damage done by your Reaver blade.  Try upgrading each`a\r\n\r\n`hof them in turn to keep your sword balanced.  Before you can store a blade`a\r\n\r\n`hspell in your blade, you must upgrade the sword to contain a slot for it. `a\r\n\r\n`hYou may buy more than one slot of each type of blade spell, although the`a\r\n\r\n`hcost goes up each time.  Once you have purchased a slot for a blade spell,`a\r\n\r\n`hyou may go to the altar of annihilation and chant the appropriate blade or`a\r\n\r\n`hburst spell.  If successful, it will be stored in the blade and will appear`a\r\n\r\n`hin <sword options>.  Once the spell is stored, you may invoke it at any`a\r\n\r\n`htime.  When you invoke the blade spell, you do not lose the slot in your`a\r\n\r\n`hblade�- it just becomes empty until you return to the altar and store`a\r\n\r\n`hanother spell in the blade.`a\r\n\r\n`a\r\n\r\n`hSKILLS\r\n\r\n`hLevel  1: shield block, sword`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel  5: trip, butcher`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel  7: invocation, kick`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 10: disarm, parry, fast healing, fishing`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 12: rescue`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 15: second attack`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 16: door bash`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 18: redirect`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 20: riding, dodge`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 23: repulse`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 25: swimming`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 28: tempt`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 35: enhanced damage`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 41: third attack`a\r\n\r\n`a\r\n\r\n`hCHANTS`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel  1: sense good, summon sword`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel  5: sense alignment`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel  7: shocking blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 10: unholy smirk`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 14: lightning burst`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 20: aura of evil`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 21: frost blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 28: ice burst`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 30: scorch metal`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 35: flaming blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 42: fire burst`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 49: chaotic blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 50: sense hidden`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 56: unholy burst`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 63: venomous blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 70: vampiric blade`a\r\n\r\n`hLevel 77: hellscape`a\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"c40b65a9-f5aa-40a3-8274-05c088cca026","LevelAccess":100,"Keywords":"REBOOT SHUTDOWN ","HelpText":"Syntax: reboot\r\n\tshutdown\r\n\r\nReboot shuts down the server.

Just keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nAll in all, RP is about taking on a completely different mindset. What that\r\nis, is completely up to you and how you want your character to act. The best\r\nway to get into it initially is to simply pretend you're in medieval times.\r\nBe a child for a while, use your imagination.

Thus, in order\r\n     to set up a room as a shop, you must create a mobile that will\r\n     act as shopkeeper.  In the mobile editor (medit), there is a command\r\n     'shop' that lets you set values that will determine how the shop\r\n     will function.  The shop command has four arguments: hours,\r\n     profit, type and delete.  Using the 'hours' argument with shop\r\n     allows you to set what type the shop opens and closes.  \r\n     The syntax is: 'shop hours [open-hour] [close-hour]'.  The times here\r\n     are in 24-hour format.  So for a shop to open at 9 am and close at\r\n     5 pm, the command would be 'shop hours 9 17'.  For a shop that is \r\n     always open, use 'shop hours 0 23'.  Using the 'profit' argument with\r\n     shop allows you to set the markups on object cost for buying and \r\n     selling.  To buy and sell products at-cost, these markup values\r\n     should be set to 100 (100% of cost).  The syntax is:\r\n     'shop profit [buy-profit] [sell-profit]'.  If you wanted to create\r\n     a shopkeeper that would sell object at 120% of cost (20% more than\r\n     their actual cost value) and buy objects at-cost, the command used\r\n     would be 'shop profit 120 100'.  Using the 'type' argument with\r\n     the shop command allows you to set which types of objects this\r\n     shop keeper will buy and sell.  Up to 5 (0-4) different object types\r\n     can be traded.   The syntax is: shop type [0-4] [item type].\r\n     So, for a shop that would be trading weapons and armor, two commands\r\n     would be used:  'shop type 0 weapon', 'shop type 1 armor'.  Valid\r\n     object types for this command are: Light, Scroll, Wand, Staff, Weapon\r\n     Treasure, Armor, Potion, Clothing, Furniture, Container, Drink Container,\r\n     Boat, Pill, Map, Portal, Warpstone, Gem, Jewelry.\r\n     The 'delete' argument for shop allows you delete item types you\r\n     have previously set.  For example, to convert the previous shop to\r\n     armor-only, the command would be 'shop delete 0'.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n  + Stocking the shop\r\n\r\n     In order to give the shop items, you must reset these item into\r\n     the shop keeper's inventory.  (Please see the RESETS section of this \r\n     document for more information.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  + Creating a pet shop or a stable\r\n\r\n     Pet shops and stables are special shop types.  In order to create\r\n     these kinds of shops you must have two consecutive vnum-ed rooms free.\r\n     If you wanted to use room vnum '5000' as a pet shop or a stable, then\r\n     room vnum '5001' would have to be created.  '5001' acts as a \r\n     'back room' for the pet shop or stable, and it's where all the animals\r\n     are held.  Back rooms for pet shops or stables should _not_ \r\n     be linked to other rooms under normal circumstances.\r\n     The store-front room (5000, here) should be flagged as either\r\n      'pet_shop' or 'stable' using the 'room' command from the room editor.\r\n     Example: edit room 5000\r\n              room pet_shop\r\n     Once this room is created, a shopkeeper mob should be created as normal\r\n     (see above).  This shopkeeper should then be set to reset into the\r\n     store-front room (5000 in this example).  All the pets or mounts\r\n     this shopkeeper can sell should then be set up with mob resets in \r\n     the back-room (5001, here.).\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"bd98c53a-934b-4c0f-8f1c-2ed092b1228b","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"shuffle ","HelpText":"syntax: Shuffle \r\n\r\nWhile trying to show off his ability to fancifully shuffle a deck of cards a voice \r\n\r\nsends him into a fit of rage and cards fly everywhere, hitting multiple targets in \r\n\r\nthe room, some more than once depending on how many cards he has in his possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"67277264-8baf-42bf-90c7-ea5e9b858490","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"SIDHE ","HelpText":"Though recognized as the common ancestor of drow and elves, the sidhe are\r\nalso direct predecessors of pixies, sylphs, and sprites.

They created the towns and the\r\n\r\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r\n\r\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r\n\r\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r\n\r\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r\n\r\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r\n\r\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r\n\r\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r\n\r\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r\n\r\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r\n\r\nwas restored to all its glory.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r\n\r\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r\n\r\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r\n\r\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother.

The Syndicate is this power.\r\n\r\nThey use money, influence, wits, and force as tools\r\n\r\nfor their power.  The Syndicate Corp. is the front\r\n\r\nfor this \"Mafia's\" illegal transactions.  Syndicate's\r\n\r\ngoal, like any other clan, is to control, dominate,\r\n\r\nconquer, etc.  However, the Syndicate takes a\r\n\r\ndifferent approach to accomplish these goals.  Most\r\n\r\nclans need to be in the spotlight, the evidence of\r\n\r\ntheir power is always visual, they need to be seen\r\n\r\nto convice people that they mean business.

They created the towns and the\r\n\r\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r\n\r\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r\n\r\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r\n\r\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r\n\r\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r\n\r\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r\n\r\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r\n\r\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r\n\r\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r\n\r\nwas restored to all its glory.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r\n\r\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r\n\r\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r\n\r\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or\r\n\r\nheard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Synn.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n`k\\`h-`a=`q$```a=`h-`k/`a is the crown of Synn, to be worn only by the purest of evil. This evil is\r\n\r\nClan Synn's goal. As it has not yet been found, Clan Synn must search the world, trying to turn\r\n\r\nall they come across to the evil, in hopes that one day they will find the one who will bestow evil\r\n\r\nupon all of the realm.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nThe first to feel the power of the crown was a human called Psylent. He tried to wear the crown, \r\n\r\nbut was zapped by its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood \r\n\r\nand filth, weary but still able to recal what had happened. On his hand was a burned engraved  \r\n\r\nimage of the crown. He was shortly transported away, and back into Thesden. Later that night \r\n\r\nhe heard a voice in dream. The voice told him that he was given a gift. That he would be the one \r\n\r\nto find the true evil. The voice told him to find others, and to kill all those who opposed him.\r\n\r\nThus began his quest to find the one who can bring pure evil among the world.\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"ee1a85c1-0797-4eb6-87c4-d33291467825","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"SYVIN ","HelpText":"The Syvin race is very similar to elves, in fact they are distant cousins.\r\nAs lovers of nature, they respect all animals, and only hunt for survival\r\npurposes.

These dreams haunted\r\n\r\nthe few Vro'ath who still had honor.... who were still true warriors of the\r\n\r\nholy `bNe'Shajh`e.  The great `bNe'Shajh`e himself flitted through these \r\n\r\ndreams, telling the Vro'ath where they had gone wrong... what they should do \r\n\r\nto fix this.  He showed them how they had been blinded by money and personal\r\n\r\npower.  They no longer worked for the greater good of the Vro'ath people! \r\n\r\nthese dreams came most strongly to one Vro'ath, the Vro'ath know as Arith.\r\n\r\n`bNe'Shajh`e made Arith remember that day, the day that Arith's family had\r\n\r\nbeen burned alive by an unforseen attack by elves.  He made Arith remember\r\n\r\nthe searing pain as Arith was consumed in fire.  He made Arith remember \r\n\r\nthat Arith lived only because of a boon granted by him.  `bNe'Shajh`e told Arith \r\n\r\nthat his life had not been spared so that he could become a slaver.  Arith was\r\n\r\nto work for the greater good of the Vro'ath people!  Because of these dreams,\r\n\r\nArith made a pilgramage to Nre'yth, home of the Vro'ath. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen Arith arrived at the ancient city he was appaled at the corruption that\r\n\r\nwas at the very heart of the city.  Even the temple itself used people as \r\n\r\npawns, seemingly trying to increase thier personal power.  This disgusted\r\n\r\n`eArith, for now the Vro'ath peopled seemed my like humans than they did \r\n\r\nhonorable Vro'ath warriors!  Even the great temple itself, the object of \r\n\r\nArith's journey, was not as it should be.  Even there one could find \r\n\r\nslaves.... corruption.... dishonor.  Arith then knelt down at the altar and\r\n\r\nthe fire within him burst out, consuming his mortal form.  Then Arith\r\n\r\nemerged from the fire, recreated.  Gone were the scars of clan Varruk, \r\n\r\nreplaced by the glowing symbol of `bNe'Shajh`e.  The first of the \r\n\r\n`aHoly Knights`e of `bNe'Shajh`e had been born.... born of fire and pain.  The\r\n\r\nVro'ath people had to be shown the corruption.

It\r\n\r\nis said that the ocean holds fish of all sizes, including several legendary\r\n\r\nfish, which nobody really knows to exist.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nIn order to properly fish for a trophy fish, one must first get a fishing pole.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate fishing pole can be purchased from the Emporium in Freeport.\r\n\r\nNext you need some bait.  Every fisherman knows the best bait is a can of\r\n\r\nworms, which can be found in Ebon Downs at the Fish and Tackle shop.  Be\r\n\r\nsure to buy PLENTY of bait, because you probably won't catch a legendary fish\r\n\r\non your first try.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nAfter procuring the necessary equipment, it's time to head to sea.  Those who\r\n\r\nare excellent swimmers can strike out on their own, while others may choose\r\n\r\nto charter a boat.  Either way, sail out into the salty blue until you find a\r\n\r\nspot you like.  There are several hot spots for fishing in the ocean and you\r\n\r\ncan never be completely sure where one will be, so if you fish for a while and\r\n\r\nonly come up with little fish, it may be time to move on to another spot.  The\r\n\r\ncloser you get to a hot spot, the larger the variance in the size of the fish.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nSo, when you have found a spot, the next step is to [`khold pole`h] and then\r\n\r\n[`kbait line`h] using your bait.  Finally, [`kcast line`h] to start fishing.  Wait a\r\n\r\nlittle while to see if you get a hit.  Typically, a chance for a nibble comes\r\n\r\naround a couple times a minute.  You can [`kreel line`h] to attempt to entice the\r\n\r\nfish around you to take a bite.  Eventually, you will feel a tug on your line.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, it's decision time.  You can [`kreel line`h] to try to hook the\r\n\r\nfish.  If it's a smaller fish, reeling right away will have a better chance of\r\n\r\nhooking it.  For larger fish, you may want to wait until you get a stronger\r\n\r\npull on the line or else you might scare it away.  With a little skill and\r\n\r\nluck, you will hook the fish.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nOnce you've hooked the fish, you need to fight it to bring it in.  You will\r\n\r\nsee the line zig through the water.  When the line tension shows up as `j***`h\r\n\r\nyou should [`kreel line`h] and wait a few seconds.  When line tension is `i***`h it's\r\n\r\ntime to [`kreel slacken`h] so that you don't snap the line.  Larger fish will\r\n\r\nfight more than smaller fish, so get ready for a challenge.  If all goes\r\n\r\nwell, you will eventually reel in the fish and have your prize.  If you\r\n\r\nlose your bait or just feel like starting over, you can [`kreel all`h] to\r\n\r\nstart over.\r\n\r\n`h\r\n\r\nSo why would anyone want to put up with all this nonsense just to catch a\r\n\r\nsilly fish?  Money and prestige.  Trophy fish can sell for incredible amounts\r\n\r\nof money.  Even the smallest fish sell for a few gold.  Larger fish over 200\r\n\r\npounds can sell in the thousands of gold.  It is said that legendary fish\r\n\r\ncan sell for as much as 15,000 gold, although they are rarely caught unless\r\n\r\nthe fisherman has the good fortune to zero in on a hotspot.  Some legendary\r\n\r\nfish even have their own names and reputations from those who have seen them\r\n\r\nand lived to escape.  Worth even more than the money prize is the bragging\r\n\r\nrights.  The heaviest catches will be recorded for posterity in the fishing\r\n\r\nhall of fame.``\r\n\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":null},{"Id":"d29680bb-9177-4225-99ed-e566379d665f","LevelAccess":100,"Keywords":"TRUST ","HelpText":"Syntax: trust <character> <level>\r\n\r\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.

The create command creates the file with you as it's owner\r\nand then puts you into the editing menu so that you can make changes\r\nto this new vocabulary file (See B.  Editing existing vocabulary files).\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Editing existing vocabulary files.\r\n\r\n    In order to edit a vocabulary file that already exists, type\r\n\"edit <filename>\" from the vocabulary file editor's main menu.  You\r\nmust be the original creator of the vocabulary file (or an extremely\r\nhigh level immortal) in order to make changes.  Once the command\r\nto edit this file has been entered, you will be placed in the editing\r\nsub-menu, which allows you to list the lines in the file, delete lines\r\nfrom the file and add new lines to the file.\r\n\r\n    1.  Adding new vocabulary entries into this file.\r\n\r\n\tTo add a new vocabulary trigger, type \"add\" from the editing\r\n        sub-menu.  You will be asked for four pieces of information,\r\n        on at a time.  The first thing you will be asked for is a list\r\n        of trigger words that will set off this trigger.  The list\r\n        can be any number of words, seperated by '&' (AND) or '|' (OR).\r\n\tThese logical operators determine which word(s) are needed\r\n        in a say or tell to the mobile.  For example, if you entered\r\n        'who&are&you' here, the words who AND are AND you would all\r\n        have to appear in the text for this trigger to be activated.\r\n        If you entered 'who|what&are&you' then the words who OR what\r\n        AND are AND you would have to appear ('who are you' would trigger\r\n        this text, and 'what are you' would also trigger this text.\r\n        Or operators ('|') are resolved before ang operators ('&')\r\n\tso \"what&this|that&is\" would be triggered by \"what is that\" and\r\n        \"what is this\", but not by \"what this that\" or \"is that\", etc.\r\n\tAfter you enter this list of words, you will be prompted for\r\n        a value representing the mood(s) in which this trigger\r\n\tshould work (see: help moods).  There are 7 moods, though\r\n        0 is reserved for non-smart-mobs.  Generally 4 is a neutral mood,\r\n\tlower than 4 is progressively more unhappy and greater than 4\r\n \tis progressively more happy.  Valid values for this entry include\r\n\tthings like '3' (if mood is 3, this trigger is valid),\r\n\t'>4' (if mood is greater than (but NOT equal to) 4, than this \r\n\ttrigger is valud), '<7' (if mood is less than 7, this trigger\r\n\tis valid).  The next value you must enter represents how the\r\n\tmob's mood should be offset if this trigger is hit.  This\r\n\tvalue can be a number, such as '6' (if this trigger is hit,\r\n\tautomatically set mob's mood to 6), an increment, such\r\n\tas '+2' (if this trigger is hit, add 2 to the mob's mood),\r\n\ta decrement, such as '-1' (if this trigger is hit, subtract 1\r\n\tfrom the mob's mood), or '-' which signifies that this trigger\r\n\tshould not affect the mob's mood at all.\r\n\tThe last piece of information you need to supply is what the \r\n\tmob should say and do when this trigger is hit.  If the mob\r\n\tsees this text in a say, it will respond in a say; if it sees\r\n\tit in a tell, it will respond in a tell.  Multiple lines\r\n\tmay be seperated by the semicolon (;).  A special keyword,\r\n\tCMD, may be used to make the mob enter regular mud commands.\r\n\tFor example, entering \"Hi, I am a mob!\" would cause the mob\r\n\tto say \"Hi, I am a mob!\" when this trigger is met.\r\n\tEntering \"I am really mad; CMD frown\" would cause the\r\n\tmob to say \"I am really mad\" and then execute the command\r\n\t'frown'.\r\n\tThere are a number of special variables (that represent information\r\n\tabout the character that tripped the trigger) that may appear in this\r\n\ttext, they are:\r\n\r\n\t\t$name   - Replace with character's name\r\n\t\t$area   - Replace with area name of area character is in\r\n\t\t$room   - Replace with room name of room character is in\r\n\t\t$level  - Replace with character's current level\r\n\t\t$race   - Replace with character's race name\r\n\t\t$clan   - Replace with character's clan name\r\n\t\t$class  - Replace with character's class name\r\n\t\t$time   - Replace with current (game) time\r\n\t\r\n\tFor example, if you created a trigger text of \"what&time&is&it\",\r\n\tyou may want to make a respond test of \"Thanks for asking $name,\r\n\tit is $time!\"  Assuming character \"Bob\" said \"what time is it?\"\r\n\tto the mobile using this vocabulary entry at 7 pm (game time), \r\n\tthe mobile would respond \"Thanks for asking, Bob, it is 7 o'clock pm!\"\r\n\tThese variables can be used with the CMD commands too, so\r\n\ta valid response text could be \"I have had enough of you.; CMD kill\r\n\t$name\".  \r\n\r\n        SPECIAL TRIGGER TEXT:  When you are adding vocabulary\r\n        triggers, rather than input a list of words at the first prompt\r\n\tyou may also enter one of two special triiger texts.  The first\r\n\tis 'DEFAULT' (note: Unlike most of the vocabulary trigger\r\n\twords, DEFAULT is case-sensitive and must always be entered\r\n\tin uppercase).  You may have as many 'DEFAULT' lines in a \r\n\tvocabulary file as you want, and these lines are used when someone\r\n\ttalks to a mob but the mob finds no regular matches within\r\n\tit's vocabulary list.  If you have more than one DEFAULT, one\r\n        will be chosen randomly when a character speaks to a mobile using\r\n        words it doesn't understand.  You may want to bait the character into\r\n\ta conversational topic of your choosing by using DEFAULT entries\r\n\tthat greet the character, and leak some information that the\r\n\tmob is prepared to talk about.  The second special trigger text\r\n\tis 'INCLUDE' (also uppercase-only).  INCLUDE allows you to\r\n\t'stack' vocabulary files on top of each other.  When you enter\r\n\tthe INCLUDE trigger text, you will only be asked for the filename\r\n\tof a vocabulary file to stack into the one you are editing.  \r\n\tNested includes (INCLUDE a file that also INCLUDES another file)\r\n\tare allowed, up to 5 levels.  After 5 levels, nesting is halted\r\n\tto avoid any possible infinite recursion loops (one file INCLUDEs\r\n\tanother, which INCLUDEs the first, etc.)  When the vocabulary\r\n        files are stacked, the mob will go through the word lists in \r\n\teach trying to find matches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. Listing currently defined vocabulary entries\r\n\r\n\tTo list the vocabulary entries you have already added to this\r\n\tparticular vocabulary file, type \"list\", and a list (with line\r\n\tnumbers) will be given.\r\n\r\n    3.  Deleting vocabulary entries\r\n\r\n        To delete a specific vocabulary entry, type \"delete <line#>\"\r\n\tto delete the \"<line#>\" line.  Line numbers may be determined\r\n\tby using the list command and using the number that appears\r\n\ton the far left.\r\n\r\nC.  Deleting  existing vocabulary files.\r\n\r\n\tTo delete a vocabulary file that you own, simply type\r\n\t\"delete <filename>\" from the main vocabulary file editing menu.\r\n\r\nD.

Werecreatures  have the ability  to shift into their beastial\r\n\r\nform, and back, without any harm  done to themselves or others`n*`h. In fact, \r\n\r\nwhen a  werecreature is shifted,  they tend  to be much stronger  than their\r\n\r\nnormal selves.  Each race becomes  a different  were creature.  Remort races \r\n\r\nare  excluded,  considered to be  much more powerful  than the  regular weak \r\n\r\nraces,  they are immune to the were gene unless it was possessed before they \r\n\r\nremorted.  During a normal race's leveling experience, each level promotes a\r\n\r\nfraction of a  chance that the race  will become either a were creature or a \r\n\r\nwere hunter.  A were hunter is one  who has a devine sense  for sniffing out \r\n\r\nwere creatures.  Were creatures and were hunters can sense each other, other \r\n\r\npeople cannot. Were hunters,  unlike the creatures  which they hunt,  do not \r\n\r\ndiffer in   their abilities  from race to race, they each possess three like \r\n\r\nskills: Sense Were, Calm were and cleanse were.\r\n\r\n\r\n`n* `hOccassionally,  the moon will force  the inner beast of a were creature to \r\n\r\n  emerge,  during this time the  were creature loses all sense of self for a \r\n\r\n  moment, and may or may not attack a fellow player in the room. \r\n\r\n`nWhat do the were hunter skills do?\r\n\r\n`hA were hunter  will always be able to detect the presence of a were creature \r\n\r\nin the room, while they may not always be able to sense exactly which person \r\n\r\nhas the were gene,  they can often  find out  through process of elimination. \r\n\r\nIf you are a nopk were creature, do not worry,  the were hunter can not kill\r\n\r\nyou. However,  he can  'calm' you,  and  put you to sleep  using  his unique \r\n\r\nknowledge  of taming  the were creature.  Once  you  are put to sleep he can \r\n\r\n'cleanse'  you,  causing you to be  one step closer  to being healed of your\r\n\r\nwere gene.  the were hunter cannot cleanse you more than once a day. However,\r\n\r\nthree such  cleanses  will completely  heal you  and you will no longer be a\r\n\r\nwerecreature.\r\n\r\n`nHow powerful are detect were and detect hunter?\r\n\r\n`hThe werecreatures ability to sense  they are in danger is much  stronger than \r\n\r\nthe  hunters  ability  to sense  who they hunt.  While a hunter  can feel the \r\n\r\nwerecreatures presense if they are in the same room, a werecreature can sense\r\n\r\na hunter as soon as he or she enters their realm of existance.  Like the were \r\n\r\nhunters  however,  a were creature will not  know who is out to  cleanse them,\r\n\r\nonly that they are present.\r\n\r\n`nSo, what were creatures can each race become?\r\n\r\n`hFor this, I have contructed a chart.\r\n\r\n`l+`e=============================================================================`l+\r\n\r\n`e|`h `hRace      `e|`h `h Beast          `e|`h`h  Resistances             `e|`h  `hVulnerabilities   `e|`h\r\n\r\n`l+`e=============================================================================`l+\r\n\r\n`e|`h Elf       `e|`h Lynx            `e|`h  Slash                   `e|`h  Pierce            `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Syvin     `e|`h Panther         `e|`h  Magic                   `e|`h  Slash             `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Dwarf     `e|`h Wolverine       `e|`h  Slash, Bash             `e|`h  Pierce, Lightning `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Canthi    `e|`h Sea Devil       `e|`h  Magic                   `e|`h  Fire              `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Sidhe     `e|`h Condor          `e|`h  Pierce                  `e|`h  Bash              `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Litan     `e|`h Dragon          `e|`h  Magic                   `e|`h  Bash              `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Vro'ath   `e|`h Boar            `e|`h  Magic                   `e|`h  Bash              `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h Human     `e|`h Wolf            `e|`h  Magic                   `e|`h  Slash             `e|`h\r\n\r\n`e|`h All       `e|`h Were Hunter     `e|`h  None                    `e|`h  None              `e|`h\r\n\r\n`l+`e=============================================================================`l+\r\n\r\n`nOOC FACTS:\r\n\r\n`n** `hWere Hunters will get a special prize each time they cleanse a were creature.
