We came to Thesden seeking a <br>better life, and greater opportunities. We had all heard of grand Thesden <br>with its streets of gold. Upon our arrival at the grat city, however, we <br>found the stories of Thesden's grandeur to be misleading at best. Thesden, <br>whatever it once might have been, is now crumbling into decay. <br>Bandits roam the streets freely, while the town guard looks on unconcerned. <br>Dangerous creatures roam the lands around Thesden as well, waiting to devour <br>the unwary traveler. Even so refugees from other lands come to Thesden <br>daily seeking a new life. More often than not, they are easy prey for <br>predators inside and outside the city's walls. The aristocracy, for some <br>reason, seems to ignore these ills. The problems of society are ignored at <br>best by the ruling class. At worst, the nobles of the day care nothing for <br>those under their rule, and crush them down with oppressive edicts and <br>taxes. We, of Clan Advocation, pledge to help others when we can, <br>especially those who are new to the lands and less able to fend for <br>themselves. We have foresworn violence against other clans and loners. <br>Whenever possible, we will do all we can to better the conditions of all <br>those who walk the path of righteousness.<br>---------------------<br><strong>Racial requirements for joining clan Advocation:</strong><br>-- Human <br>-- Elf <br>-- Syvin <br>-- Canthi <br>-- Avatar<br>---------------------<br><strong>Class requirements for joining clan Advocation:</strong><br>-- Paladin <br>-- Mage <br>-- Cleric <br>-- Bard <br>-- Druid</p>\n<p>---------------------<br><strong>Other requirements for joining clan Advocation:</strong><br>Must be of level 50 or greater. <br>Must be willing to help others. <br>Must have basic knowledge of areas and items.<br>---------------------<br><strong>Why join clan Advocation?</strong><br>Very large clan hall. <br>Bank in clan hall. <br>Nice clan gear. <br>Regular rewards for assisting others. <br>Large clan donation. <br>Portals in clan hall to convenient areas. <br>Free player room upon joining. <br>Earn double NH points. <br>Ability to create newbie boxes.<br>---------------------<br><strong>OOC NOTES: <em>(Important)</em></strong><br>Clan Advocation is partially Immortal run, the clan is not for PK. This clan is for people who wish to lend a hand to new players, and who wish to strive to do everything they can to raise the player base of&nbsp;<br>this game by being kind, considerate and helpful. If you join clan Advocation, the alt you join with can NEVER go PK again. You may leave the clan, but will be unable to convert to pk. With this&nbsp;method I hope to prevent people from joining for clan gear, and leaving to PK. The clan gear Advocation offers is the best because it's for players who will be risking their lives to help others&nbsp;equip, raid or get out of a sticky situation, and will NEVER be used to get one up in PK.&nbsp;Because of this, any memer of clan Advocation is also banned from Battle Royales, Super Duels, and the Arena.</p>\n<p>The portals in the clan hall are for getting to people in need FAST. They are not for helping someone PK in anyway. Lastly, being a part of clan Advocation means taking on an extra burden.&nbsp;<br>It means not only must you answer anybody's call for help, no matter how stupid it may seem, as long as you have the Advocation clan symbol infront of your name, you help them. In addition to&nbsp;helping mortals, you will be higher up the ranks for helping immortals come up with new ideas for quests, classes, races and anything else that might help the games progress.</p>\n<p>And on the very final note: Any player to find a way around any of these rules will be kicked out of Advocation, frozen for life, and banned for four weeks. </p>","Category":"Clans","Tags":["Advocation"],"RelatedTags":["clan","guild"]},{"Id":"ee82c64d-941f-4ee4-9a40-f6cf3f9e6d41","LevelAccess":92,"Keywords":"AEDIT ","HelpText":"<p><strong>Syntax</strong>: edit area&nbsp;<br>- Enters the editor for the current area.&nbsp;<br>The following commands are available from within the <strong>AEDITOR</strong>: <br><strong>age</strong> - set the age of the area <br><strong>commands</strong>&nbsp;- prints a list of possible commands <br><strong>creator</strong> - set name of creator (for credits) <br><strong>create</strong> - create a brand new area and switch to it <br><strong>done</strong> -&nbsp;exits the area editor and returns to normal play <br><strong>filename</strong> - change the file name for the area (be careful) <br><strong>name</strong> - change the 'AREAS' name of this area <br><strong>reset</strong> - resets the current area <br><strong>show</strong> - hitting return, or 'show' shows the area stats <br><strong>lev</strong> - set suggested player-levels <br><strong>llev</strong> - set the lower suggested player level&nbsp;<br><strong>ulev</strong> - set the upper suggested player level&nbsp;<br><strong>lvnum</strong> - set the lower vnum <br><strong>uvnum</strong> - set the upper vnum <br>- area flags, type ?

The city <br>of Thesden could barely withstand the fierce onslaught of forces far superior <br>to the armies of the humans. <br><br>The roads became unsafe. All cities were surrounded and famine spread its <br>evil arms, embracing the people in hopelessness and despair. The Knights of the <br>Argent Lance fought bravely together with the Thesden guards to drive out <br>the vicious hordes, but to little avail. <br><br>No one knows where they came from. Riding great warhorses and with lances bright <br>and innumerable, a charge swept the outskirts of the city like a tidal wave, driving <br>away the vro'aths and leaving destruction in its wake. Many they were, noble <br>with grim faces from which the orcs ran away in terror. They bore great silver <br>shields and smote their enemy with the sheer power of their armor, their swords long <br>and deadly with blinding rays from above. <br><br>Many vro'aths fell during this first assault. The remaining few, not willing to <br>withdraw from their hated enemies, gathered round their banner of crimson red and <br>withstood their ground. The echoes of battle rang far and away. <br><br>Filled with battle lust, the Argent Lance Knights exited the city on foot to fight <br>the remnants of the evil army together with these unknown holy warriors. Together, <br>they drove the enemy away with great loss. <br><br>The Holy Alliant Order thus established themselves in Thesden, and from there, great <br>campaigns against the vroaths were planned. Slowly the land was returned to <br>peace, and trade began to flourish again. <br><br>In Thesden, the White Tower was constructed to house the Knights of the Alliant order, <br>who swore alliance to the king. Many youngsters applied as squires and apprentices <br>in the hope of becoming paladins and priests. The order grew at an impressive rate. <br>Now... evil is spreading and the order is facing many struggles. The King was <br>assassinated and an impostor occupies his place. The Order will not carry the will <br>of the Assassin, so it faces prosecution. Their friendship with the Argent Lance <br>is broken, and many of their main members have been murdered.

Rooms do not come cheap and they cannot be built everywhere.\r\nIf you wish to build your own room, you must acquire enough money to buy\r\nthe room, and must find a suitable development area in which to stake\r\nyour claim.  Once you find this area, you can use the build command with\r\na directional argument to build your room in that direction from the\r\ncurrent room.  Once you have built your first room, you can expand at will,\r\ncreating constructs to the limits of your imagination.\r<br>\n   Your room starts out in a very minimal, bare state.  In order to customize\r\nthe room to your tastes, you should enter the room and type the build command\r\nagain, without any arguments.  This will put you into a build menu that\r\nallows you to easily and quickly change your room to match your tastes,\r\nassuming you can afford the changes.  The prices for each change will be\r\nlisted on the build menu.\r<br>\n   The main building menu presents you with six choices:\r<br>\n     (1) Remodel your room    : Allows you to change the description of you\r\n                                room, so that players see a different message\r\n                                when they 'look' in your room.\r<br>\n     (2) Rename your room     : Allows you to change the name of your room\r\n                                that appears above your room description when\r\n                                players type 'look' in your room.\r<br>\n     (3) Edit room flags      : Allows you to add or remove special flags\r\n                                in your room.\r<br>\n     (4) Edit room keywords   : Allows you to create and remove special room\r\n                                keywords, so that when players type\r\n                                'look <keyword>' in your room, they see the\r\n                                description you supplied.\r<br>\n     (5) Edit room doors/keys : Allows you to create or remove doors and keys\r\n                                from your room, to limit access.\r<br>\n     (6) Exit building menu   : Exits the building menu and brings you back\r\n                                to the main exodus prompt.\r<br><br>\n   If you choose the remodeling room option, you will be placed into a\r\nsmall text editor that you can use to enter the new description of your room.\r\nWhen you are finished, you should type the '@' key and hit return on an\r\notherwise blank line.\r<br>\n   If you choose the rename room option, you will be prompted for the new\r\nroom name.  Enter it carefully, as the line you enter will become your new\r\nroom name unless you choose to buy a new one.\r<br>\n   If you choose the edit room flags option, you will be placed in a submenu\r\nthat allows you to easily add and remove flags.  To add a flag, simply\r\ntype 'A' followed by the number of the room flag to add (shown on the menu)\r\nand return.  If you have enough money to buy the room flag, it will be\r\nadded to your room.  If you change your mind, you can delete flags you have\r\nadded by selecting '2' followed by the number of the room flag to remove\r\n(also shown on the menu) and return.  You may leave this submenu and go back\r\nto the main menu by typing '3' followed by return.  The flags available\r\nfor adding to your room include: Room is dark (the room is always dark,\r\nthose without light sources cannot see inside it), No Mobs Allowed (mobs\r\ncannot enter your room), Room is Private (only two people may be in your\r\nroom at one time), No Mounts Allowed (no mounted mobiles will be allowed\r\nin your room), Room is Indoors (the room is indoors and its inside will\r\nnot be affected by the weather or time of day).\r<br>\n   If you choose the edit keyword option, you will be placed in a submenu\r\nthat allows you to add and remove keywords.  To add a keyword, select\r\n'1' at this menu.  You will be prompted for the keyword name and for\r\nthe description that should be shown when this keyword is looked at.\r\nIf you later change your mind, you can use the '2' option at this menu\r\nto delete the keyword.  You may leave this submenu and go back to the main\r\nmenu by typing '3' followed by return.\r<br><br>\n  If you choose the doors/key edit option, you will be placed in a submenu\r\nthat allows you to add and remove doors and keys.  To add a lockable door\r\nto your room, select '1' followed the the letter for the room direction\r\n(supplied on the menu) and return.  The door will be created for you.\r\nIf you change your mind and wish to delete a door, select '2' at this menu\r\nfollowed by the letter for the room direction and return.  If you want to\r\nmake a single key for a door you have created, to limit access to your\r\nroom, select '3' at this menu.  You may leave this submenu and go back to\r\nthe manu menu by typing '4' followed by return.\r<br>\n  You may leave the build menu and return to the normal exodus prompt by\r\ntyping '6' at the main menu.\r<br><br>\n CLAN HALLS: Clan leaders can also build clan halls specifically for\r\ntheir clan's use.  The procedure is the same as above, except for an added\r\ncharge, the clan leader can specify a CLAN_ONLY flag.\r<br>\n SHOPS:  Players can also build shops using the build system.

A plot that\r\nplayers can identify with and impacts them personally in the game, are the\r\nkinds that will intrigue players the most.  Another method of adding or\r\nextending a storyline is to introduce long-term foes. Long-term foes that\r\nturn up from time to time to make life difficult for the players add to\r\nthe story.  In other terms, this would be called a campaign.  Stories are\r\nlimited only to the imagination.\r<br><br>\nPUZZLES/BRAINTEASERS\r<br>\n  Next in line are the puzzles and brainteasers.  Players should never be\r\nallowed to go from the starting point (story/plot) to the combat sequence\r\nwithout being forced to resolve some kind of puzzle or a multitude of\r\npuzzles.  There are many kinds of puzzles from the traditional riddles to\r\ncomplex puzzles.  Multiple puzzles allow teams to compete against each\r\nother in a race to solve the puzzles the quickest.  One example of a\r\npuzzle is to tell players to find and goto multiple locations without\r\ntransport spells using the clues you provide.\r<br>\nCOMBAT\r<br>\n  Combat is the next element of the quest.  Combat can be the climax of\r\nthe quest or an anti-climax depending on whether you wish to stress the\r\npuzzles or the combat sequences.\r<br>\n  If you want the puzzles to be the focus, place more emphasis on the\r\npuzzles by making them tougher and taking more time to resolve than\r\ndefeating the combat mob.  If you want the combat sequences to be the\r\nfocus, make the mob extremely difficult to kill and take up more time than\r\nthe puzzles.  When creating mobs for the players to fight, consider giving\r\nthe mob equipment that fits in with the storyline.  Even minor trappings\r\nlike bracers or rings can be used to add flavor. For lower level questers,\r\njust make certain that you get the items back, period.  Do NOT leave quest\r\neq in the players hands.\r<br>\nRemember, it is your quest, you set the rules.

As a result,\r\n            a conversion system has been created to get the old-style\r\n            players into the new-style system.\r<br>\n            When you log in, you are moved to jail, but you are not being\r\n            punished.  We just need to get you out of circulation.  You\r\n            have all your equipment and all your public channels.  Also,\r\n            you will have easy access to food and water this way.  If you\r\n            want to stay under the old-style system and simply chat, you\r\n            may do so.  Or, if you wish to speak with an immortal before\r\n            going through conversion, you have that option as well.\r<br>\n            If you do go through conversion, you will receive a lump sum\r\n            of experience for your old-style levels and skills.  The higher\r\n            your various skills were, the more exp you get for each of them.\r<br>\n            The first thing to be aware of is that your stats have been\r\n            rerolled.  If you do not like your stats, you can reroll over\r\n            and over using the reroll command.  This command can only\r\n            be used at level 1, so once you advance, you're stuck with\r\n            your stats.\r<br>\n            Your character will automatically have every skill and spell/\r\n            prayer/song/chant that your class can get at 1%.  There is no\r\n            longer any need to pick and choose.  Practice points are gone\r\n            and you will practice your skills by spending experience\r\n            points.\r<br>\n            Training points are still here, although you can no longer\r\n            train hp/mana/move.  It's ok, though, because you can improve\r\n            them by spending exp as well, but you should not worry about\r\n            that right now.  At level 1, you have two training points.\r\n            Once you have a reroll that you like, spend you training points\r\n            on your stats.  Now you're ready to advance.\r<br>\n            The cost of advancing rises steadily as you go up, so you should\r\n            check your total exp after every level advancement.  For each of\r\n            the first ten levels, you will get another training point to use\r\n            on your stats.  Use them as you go so you can take advantage of\r\n            their benefits right away.\r<br>\n            It's important to take care when building your character because\r\n            if you spend too much exp on levels, you will not have as much\r\n            to spend on skills and spells.  Likewise, you should not rush\r\n            off and practice your skills and spells to 100% right away\r\n            because the cost of practicing rises steadily as well.\r<br>\n            My suggestion would be to deal with advancing to level 10 first\r\n            and spend your training sessions along the way.  Once you are\r\n            at level 10, look at your skills and spells and start\r\n            practicing them.  they all start off very cheap and they all\r\n            end up very expensive.  Practice the ones you want to about 50%\r\n            and then check your exp to make sure you have enough.  You can\r\n            always top them off later.  After this, strike a balance\r\n            between advancing levels and practicing skills and spells.\r\n            You will notice that your final character will be nowhere near\r\n            as powerful as you were under the old system.  It's ok though,\r\n            because you will be more powerful than those who you were more\r\n            powerful than under the old system and there is so much more\r\n            possibility to grow now.\r<br>\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r\n:============================================================================:\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["CONVERSION"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"a1cf29ce-de72-4102-8e58-fe81c39d543e","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Convicted ","HelpText":"","Category":null,"Tags":["Convicted"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"df85e2a0-4e93-4d28-8260-733f4bbfbb2e","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Convicts ","HelpText":"Clan convicts is for permanently (or near permanently) jailed characters.\r<br>\nOnly preconversion characters, or characters with over 1000 ticks of jail\r<br>\ntime may apply.

This command must be typed twice with your valid password\r<br>\nto delete a character, and you cannot be forced to delete.

[HELP DRAMA]\r<br>\nTo assist in the process, a guide has been created listing a number of\r<br>\npopular methods by which a character can leave the world of Exodus.\r<br><br><br>\n1) The silent goodbye, Drama Level 0. The player simply deletes the character\r<br>\nand the world moves on.  While this method has the most class, it is the\r<br>\nrarest method used.\r<br><br><br>\n2) The goodbye note, Drama Level 1.  The player writes a final note telling\r<br>\nthe world he/she is leaving and wishing friends well and wishing enemies\r<br>\nill.  An email address is often left as well.\r<br><br><br>\n3) The cry for help, Drama Level 2.  This generally happens after a player\r<br>\nhas experienced a perceived injustice and has usually decided to delete\r<br>\nalready, but will give the imms \"one last chance\" by making a generally\r<br>\nunreasonable request, often on public channels.  When the request is denied,\r<br>\nthe player will often follow step 2 or in extreme cases, step 4.\r<br><br><br>\n4) The angry spammer, Drama Level 3.  This character has given up all hope\r<br>\nof avoiding deletion and has decided to vent frustration to everyone because\r<br>\nhe/she has nothing to lose.  Obscinity-laced messages on OOC are often\r<br>\ndelivered in rapid succession resulting in loss of public channels.  If the\r<br>\nanger has not been satisfied, the angry spammer will often delete and then\r<br>\nlog on an alt to continue the angry spamming.  You might think this is the\r<br>\nmost extreme method, but sadly, there is one more type.\r<br><br><br>\n5) The war of attrition, Drama Level 4.  This character wishes to go out\r<br>\nwith a bang, often utilizing methods 2, 3, or 4, but never method 1.  The\r<br>\ndifference is that this character wishes to hang around to witness the\r<br>\naftermath of his/her departure and therein lies the flaw.  How can you\r<br>\nwitness the aftermath of a departure that does not happen?  Clever\r<br>\nplayers have devised a strategy to handle this problem by staging high\r<br>\ndrama, then deleting, then logging on an alt to listen.  In extreme cases,\r<br>\nthe war of attrition will continue long after everyone thinks it is over\r<br>\nbecause the deleted character will show up again and either make an\r<br>\nunreasonable request, complain that others are mistreating him/her, or\r<br>\nhang around and badmouth Exodus in general, perhaps hoping to catch a\r<br>\nnewbie who is trying out the game for the first time.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r<br>\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r<br>\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r<br>\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r<br>\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r<br>\n| tire Vro'ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r<br>\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r<br>\n| together in the name of the great god Ne'Shajh, and united under the    |\r<br>\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r<br>\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro'ath |\r<br>\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r<br>\n| `reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r<br>\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r<br>\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r<br>\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r<br>\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r<br>\n| `side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r<br>\n| the name of Ne'Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r<br>\n|                                                                         |\r<br>\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r<br>\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r<br>\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne'Shajh  |\r<br>\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro'ath race as the dominant race    |\r<br>\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r<br>\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro'ath race is superior to all others, | \r<br>\n| d that only the Vro'ath deserve to rule.

Kryian also added, \"Wizard have always been and important\r<br>\nrole in defending great kingdoms, and if Brotherhood expects to keep\r<br>\ndefending this great kingdom, then we will need the wisdom and mystical\r<br>\npowers a wizard possess.\"\r<br>\n     \r<br>\nRequirements to join Clan Brotherhood:\r<br>\n          \r<br>\nRace: Human, Dwarven, and Elven\r<br>\n          \r<br>\nClasses: Warrior, Paladin, Cleric, and Mage\r<br>\n          \r<br>\nAlignment: Good, and Neutral\r<br>\n          \r<br>\nAdditional Requirements: Must be atleast level 50, and must be approved by two lords of Brotherhood (leader or deputies),\r<br>\nand may have to perform additional tasks and/or quests.\r<br>\n          \r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["eq"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"5cd5a406-33a2-4842-9739-38260f5c2971","LevelAccess":0,"Keywords":"EQUIPMENT INVENTORY ","HelpText":"Syntax: equipment\r\nSyntax: inventory\r<br>\nEQUIPMENT lists the equipment you are wearing (ex. armor, weapons, and held items).\r\nINVENTORY lists what is in your inventory.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["EQUIPMENT","INVENTORY"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"e3e68161-3bfc-475c-9ca0-0ef0c9f4f4aa","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"erratic bolt ","HelpText":"syntax: syntax: cast 'erratic bolt' target\r<br>\nThe Chaos Jester sends a bolt of warped magic out into the air causing general havoc \r<br>\nand chaos for any players or creatures unlucky enough to be in the room with him.\r<br><br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["erratic","bolt"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"d25ae7ec-6727-413d-a04b-ed08a3071635","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Escargot ","HelpText":"{{{ ... _@%            Clan Escargot             ... _@%  }}}\r<br>\n         \r<br>\nClan Escargot was formed, some say, as a direct result of the great\r<br>\ngod Iverath's absence.  Not long after his departure, strange things\r<br>\nstarted happening, and people began doing odd things for no apparent\r<br>\nreason.  Experts said that, without Iverath, the total silliness\r<br>\nlevel of the lands dropped drastically, and these random actions were\r<br>\nthe universe's way of compensating.\r<br>\n           \r<br>\n    Whatever the case may be, soon afterwards, a young Elven girl\r<br>\nnamed Desrielle was visited in visions by a great and powerful god.\r<br>\nThis god took the form of a snail, and called himself Biff the\r<br>\nWonder Snail.  He told Desrielle that it was her destiny to establish\r<br>\na clan, the likes of which had never been seen in the land before.\r<br>\nThis clan, he said, would exist for one purpose and objective only:\r<br>\n                  to be silly.\r<br>\n       \r<br>\n    Almighty Biff saw, in his wisdom, that his children would need\r<br>\nhelp accomplishing his desires for them... And so he told Desrielle\r<br>\nthat the clan would require a few things of its members.  First, they\r<br>\nmust generally, but not strictly, be evil, as morals are bad for\r<br>\nserious silliness.  Second, they must be of a race capable of extreme\r<br>\nsilliness - Sidhe, though mischievous, are too purely evil to pull\r<br>\nthe kinds of pranks that require a group effort - they're simply too\r<br>\nself-serving, Biff told her.  Vro'ath, though silly in their own right,\r<br>\nare simply not intelligent enough to keep up with the demands of the\r<br>\nmind that Clan Escargot would make of them.  And finally, Avatars,\r<br>\nthough they can be intelligent and silly, cannot risk themselves in th\r<br>\nways that true silliness requires.\r<br>\n           \r<br>\n    Biff also decreed that members of Clan Escargot should be\r<br>\nappropriately accented in their speech at all times, and that they\r<br>\nshould consider themselves at all times and in all ways exempt from\r<br>\nthe laws of society, the government, fair play, and so forth.  The\r<br>\nreason for this, of course, is that laws of any kind only hinder and\r<br>\ndiscourage silliness.\r<br>\n       \r<br>\n       \r<br>\nRequirements for joinging Clan Escargot:\r<br>\n       \r<br>\nYou must be at least level 9 (duh.)\r<br>\nYou must be Human, Elf, Syvin, Dwarf, Canthi, or Litan.\r<br>\nYou may be of any class.\r<br>\nYou must be silly!\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["Escargot"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"c33947d7-e5a0-435a-9a7e-3ac2ba775e15","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"evil twin ","HelpText":"syntax: cast 'evil twin' <target player>\r<br>\nComing soon.\r<br><br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["evil","twin"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"c5584bea-425e-466c-9e38-a806d518181c","LevelAccess":0,"Keywords":"EVOCATION ","HelpText":"Syntax: pray evocation <character>\r<br>\nThe evocation prayer allows powerful clerics to summon forth players in\r\nany part of the world to them.

Little is\r<br>\nknown of their origins or their history.  The knowledge gleaned through\r<br>\ncareful examination of old, rotting histories is almost worthless.  The\r<br>\nmost common information comes from the reptition of children's stories\r<br>\nand bardic tales in remote areas of the world, such as the Teche Bayou\r<br>\nand the Desert of Ath'Tanar.  The common elements within these stories\r<br>\nstresses the isolationist nature of the Sidhe, and their mischievious\r<br>\nways.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nTimes however, have changed.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nFor reasons known only to the Sidhe, the creatures have been appearing\r<br>\nmore and more in civilized areas.  Attempts at communication with the\r<br>\nrace have, for the most part, failed.  Successful communication with\r<br>\nelder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of\r<br>\nknowledge of  WHY the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.  Reknowned \r<br>\nhistorian Armedius Hirinjakk has noted one consistency through this\r<br>\nchaotic migration.  They are all progressing toward the south.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\n        [Clan Jhereg]\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nThe House of Jhereg formed as a response to displeasure with Clan\r<br>\nDivergent.  How any Sidhe could defile themselves to follow the\r<br>\nphilosophy of a non-sidhe named Auvyron and become embroiled in the\r<br>\nconflicts of the lesser races is beyond our reasoning.  To go further\r<br>\nand pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.  Not only is their\r<br>\nphilsophic stance untenable, their willingness to sacrifice themselves\r<br>\nfor Ayvyron is indicative of extremely psychological instability.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nOutwardly, House Jhereg seeks to control Thesden.  Chaos rules Thesden.\r<br>\nFerath Athanmere has ruled for over twenty years, unopposed.  The Clans\r<br>\nare engaged in open warfare.  The law is dead letter, and Thesden Guard\r<br>\nis unstable - acting one moment as mindless observer and the next as\r<br>\nvicious press gang.  We are displeased.  House Jhereg outwardly seeks\r<br>\ntwo goals - first, control crime in Thesden (thus solidfying their\r<br>\nposition as an organized crime syndicate) and secondly, two over throw\r<br>\nFerath Athanmere of Castle Dunluce and seat their in the position of\r<br>\npower.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\n        [Misc.]\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nExcerpt from the Journal of Morian e'Drien - The Grey Mouse\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nDay of Thunder, 23rd the Month of winter\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nChaos rules the land.  The Government of Ferath Athanmere in Thesden is\r<br>\ndead letter.  The motives of the priest class in the City of the Sun are\r<br>\nunfathomable.  Whenever I have a quiet moment I feel a strange beckoning\r<br>\nfrom the south.  I look there in my dreams and see only darkness.  I\r<br>\nhear the murmering of the wizards and the philosophers, I read the\r<br>\nhistories and hear the stories from dark corners.  I am discontent.  I\r<br>\nmust know what is happening.  My people have left their solitude.  I\r<br>\nfind myself more and more entering these walled areas and exposing\r<br>\nmyself to the cacophony of the lesser races.  Today I find myself in\r<br>\nThesden.  A strange city.  I shall explore.  I feel compelled.  I should\r<br>\nfind others.

On the mirror port, no current alts\r<br>\n         are affected by the changes they will undergo. Hell \r<br>\n         Nights are always full PK, meaning that no one is safe\r<br>\n         from being killed by another player. If you play an\r<br>\n         Avatar, you may use it on Hell Night, if you die you\r<br>\n         do NOT lose your Avatar. However, the immortal will\r<br>\n         most likely NOT want to restore your Avatar, as for \r<br>\n         you to continue to play it on a Hell Night. They will\r<br>\n         have a lot of other things going on, and will not have\r<br>\n         time to do something like this. So it is suggested that\r<br>\n         you not use an Avatar on Hell Night.\r<br><br><br><br><br>\n         On Hell Night, all wishes are granted. But you do not \r<br>\n         get to keep anything you recieve for free. The immortal\r<br>\n         running Hell Night may or may not wish to also run quests\r<br>\n         which will allow you to recieve benefits that will roll \r<br>\n         over onto the active Exodus Port. All quests will and MUST\r<br>\n         be altered in a way that will still post a challenge for\r<br>\n         the players involved, since they will have unlimited access\r<br>\n         to item editing's and enhancements. Immortals may also chose\r<br>\n         to run quests, and not have the benefits roll over. If you\r<br>\n         participate in a quest on Hell Night and get a prize, but \r<br>\n         the prize is not awarded to your standard alt on the live\r<br>\n         port of Exodus, please do not whine about it unless you \r<br>\n         were told explicitly that the prize would be awarded to \r<br>\n         your live alt. Doing such things will result in punishment.\r<br><br><br>\n         If you ask an Immortal running Hell Night for any item in \r<br>\n         the world, they must oblige. If asked, the Immortal hosting\r<br>\n         Hell Night will also boost your Hit Points, Moves, and Mana.\r<br>\n         They may or may NOT agree to edit an item for you.

Necromancers\r<br>\nare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand\r<br>\ncombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer\r<br>\nand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between\r<br>\nlife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to\r<br>\nanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. \r<br><br><br>\nNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and\r<br>\nrituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to\r<br>\nperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a\r<br>\nfocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,\r<br>\nhexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects\r<br>\nrespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer\r<br>\nthey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the\r<br>\nnecromancer's own blood to draw. \r<br><br><br>\nUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which\r<br>\ntype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are\r<br>\nskeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a\r<br>\nnatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.\r<br>\nWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come\r<br>\nfrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always\r<br>\nbeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a\r<br>\nplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains\r<br>\nand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that\r<br>\nphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some\r<br>\ninnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in\r<br>\ncombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty\r<br>\napparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark\r<br>\nhood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be\r<br>\nunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for\r<br>\na lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies\r<br>\nfrozen with fear.\r<br><br><br>\n>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<\r<br><br><br>\nSKILLS\r<br>\nLevel  1: dagger, staff\r<br>\nLevel  2: swimming\r<br>\nLevel  5: wands\r<br>\nLevel  6: staves\r<br>\nLevel 10: envenom\r<br>\nLevel 13: draw: pentagram\r<br>\nLevel 14: leeching\r<br>\nLevel 15: butcher\r<br>\nLevel 16: corpse carving\r<br>\nLevel 18: fishing\r<br>\nLevel 20: meditation\r<br>\nLevel 22: embalm\r<br>\nLevel 22: embalm\r<br>\nLevel 23: draw: hexagram\r<br>\nLevel 24: unsummon\r<br>\nLevel 25: sense death\r<br>\nLevel 30: riding\r<br>\nLevel 33: hellbreath\r<br>\nLevel 34: draw: death ward\r<br>\nLevel 40: feign death\r<br>\nLevel 47: corrupt\r<br>\nLevel 50: draw: septagram\r<br>\nLevel 52: feed death\r<br>\nLevel 60: feast\r<br><br><br>\n>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<\r<br><br><br>\nCHANTS\r<br>\nLevel  1: lich eyes\r<br>\nLevel  5: astral body\r<br>\nLevel  7: nearsight\r<br>\nLevel  8: pox\r<br>\nLevel 10: skeletal mutation\r<br>\nLevel 14: exoskeleton\r<br>\nLevel 15: knowledge of the dead, atrophy\r<br>\nLevel 17: festering boils\r<br>\nLevel 18: death vision\r<br>\nLevel 23: animate dead\r<br>\nLevel 26: corpse walk\r<br>\nLevel 27: intoxicate\r<br>\nLevel 28: calling\r<br>\nLevel 29: seizure\r<br>\nLevel 30: darkhounds\r<br>\nLevel 31: eldritch miasma\r<br>\nLevel 36: immunity\r<br>\nLevel 37: bone puppet\r<br>\nLevel 40: ghost form, bone craft\r<br>\nLevel 45: wind of death\r<br>\nLevel 46: drain aura\r<br>\nLevel 47: vomit\r<br>\nLevel 49: jinx, decay\r<br>\nLevel 50: unholy ceremony\r<br>\nLevel 51: demonic possession\r<br>\nLevel 55: brain blisters\r<br>\nLevel 60: clasp\r<br>\nLevel 62: death palm\r<br>\nLevel 66: vampirism\r<br>\nLevel 67: greymantle\r<br>\nLevel 75: bone hail\r<br>\nLevel 76: dark sphere\r<br>\nLevel 80: beacon of the damned\r<br>\nLevel 81: soul link\r<br>\nLevel 85: death shroud\r<br>\nLevel 86: swell\r<br><br><br>\n>@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@< >@<\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["k","ball"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"388f63d1-429f-428f-ba34-28da6f237b18","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"KAAOSS1 ","HelpText":"|--------------------------------<+<==>+>--------------------------------|\r<br>\n        \r<br>\n                               CLAN MINIONS\r<br>\n        \r<br>\nLong before mortals, before Gods, before time...

Litans in their home environment are nomads,\r<br>\nliving in dynamic, socially ordered tribes with very little outside contact.\r<br>\nTheir appearance is humanoid in general form, having four limbs and walking\r<br>\nupright - but there the resemblance ends.  Their bodies are covered in dull\r<br>\nscales, ranging in color from a light yellow, almost white, to a deep\r<br>\nblack-red.  Their faces are featureless, smooth and rounded, with eyes like\r<br>\ngleaming coal-black slits.  Their feet have three clawed toes, webbed to\r<br>\nassist them in navigation of the sandy dunes.  Probably the most interesting\r<br>\naspect of creatures is the slimy secretion that covers their scales.  This\r<br>\nsubstance is highly flammable, and the Litans have developed a specialized\r<br>\nmethod of utilizing it - two of their teeth are ridged, and can produce\r<br>\nsparks if clicked together properly, sending the Litan up in flames.  It is\r<br>\nan unnerving sight for those unaccustomed to Litans to see one in this\r<br>\nstate.  They are, however, immune to heat and fire, and will never be\r<br>\ndamaged by them, so to a Litan, setting oneself on fire is part and parcel\r<br>\nof life.\r<br>\nLitans are a proud race, temperamental and stubborn.  Their cultural\r<br>\ntradition of tattooing their scales with flamelike and lightning patterns\r<br>\nstems from the love of broadcasting their greatness to the world.  They\r<br>\nboast and brag of their accomplishments and prowess to anyone near them - a\r<br>\nhabit that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with those more powerful\r<br>\nthan they.  In addition, they tend to be explosive and fiery, like the\r<br>\nsubstance they secrete.  Unfortunately, not being the most intelligent\r<br>\nbeings, they don't always make good judgements and sometimes end up dead for\r<br>\nit.  Although Litans can form bonds of friendship, they generally have no\r<br>\nfamilial ties or maternal instinct, and the concept of 'marriage' is a\r<br>\nforeign one - mating is done easy-come, easy-go, generally when tribes meet\r<br>\nin the desert, and they lay eggs deep underneath the sand.  Their eggs are\r<br>\nfabled objects, being extremely hard to find and very beautiful.  Most are\r<br>\nslightly incandescent, glowing softly from within, while the outer shell is\r<br>\nanywhere from creamy off-white through yellow, red, and pitch black, some\r<br>\nshaded and marbled beautifully. \r<br>\nDue to a peculiar forked tongue and rigid palate, Litans are unable to\r<br>\ncommunicate with other beings by normal means.  Instead, they use a\r<br>\nhigh-pitched shriek, much like a shout, which can be heard from long\r<br>\ndistances. \r<br>\nStrength      ****........\r<br>\nDexterity     *********...\r<br>\nConstitution  ****........\r<br>\nIntelligence  ............\r<br>\nWisdom        ............\r<br>\nCharisma      ............\r<br><br><br>\nLitans have natural immunity to fire.\r<br>\nLitans have natural vulnerability to cold attacks.\r<br>\nLitans takes additional damage in water.\r<br>\nLitans are medium-sized.\r<br>\nLitans regenerate faster near a fire.\r<br>\nLitans are more nimble in sunny weather.\r<br>\nLitans may set themselves on fire with the \"flame\" command.\r<br>\nLitans may flare up to blind their opponents.\r<br>\nLitans are unable to communicate as other races do.\r<br>\nLitans may join the following guilds:\r<br>\nWarrior, Paladin, Ranger, Cleric, Assassin, Thief, Reaver.\r<br>\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r<br>\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r<br>\n:============================================================================:\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["litan"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"238c7b28-5df4-489a-8bcd-624b86996e79","LevelAccess":95,"Keywords":"LOAD ","HelpText":"Syntax: load mob <vnum>\r\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\r<br>\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to\r\nduplicate strung items and mobs).

The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r<br>\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r<br>\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r<br>\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r<br>\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r<br>\nwas restored to all its glory.\r<br>\n    \r<br>\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r<br>\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r<br>\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r<br>\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother.

At creation,\r<br>\n   a character chooses a guild to follow.  For instance, a character named\r<br>\n   Possum chooses to be a warrior at creation.  The character is then\r<br>\n   considered a stage 1 warrior.  Any stage 1 guildmember has the ability\r<br>\n   to learn any skills, spells, songs, prayers, or chants of that guild up\r<br>\n   to level 30.  At level 31, Possum can either choose to continue to be a\r<br>\n   more advanced warrior, or he can choose to become any other class his\r<br>\n   race permits.  If he chooses to become an assassin, then he will be a\r<br>\n   stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin and will be able to learn skills\r<br>\n   up to level 30 in both guilds as his own level permits.  If he chooses\r<br>\n   to remain a warrior at level 31, he will become a stage 2 warrior.  Any\r<br>\n   stage 2 guildmember will be able to practice all stage 1 skills as well\r<br>\n   as the more advanced stage 2 skills of that guild.  Upon reaching level\r<br>\n   61, Possum will be given a third choice.  If he already chose to become\r<br>\n   a stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin, he might also choose to\r<br>\n   become a stage 1 thief.  He will be very well-rounded, but he will\r<br>\n   possess none of the advanced skills of any of the guilds he is a member\r<br>\n   of.  If Possum had previously chosen to become a stage 2 warrior and he\r<br>\n   wishes to stay a warrior, he can become a stage 3 warrior.  As a stage\r<br>\n   3 warrior, Possum will have access to the most advanced skills of the\r<br>\n   warrior guild, as well as all stage 1 and stage 2 warrior skills.\r<br><br>\n   Multiclass can seem a bit overwhelming, since there are over 100 paths\r<br>\n   a character can take.  If you are daunted by the choices, just remember\r<br>\n   you can always stay in your chosen guild and become a specialist and\r<br>\n   you will not be any worse off for doing so.\r<br><br>\nRelated helps: [Help Class] [Help Remort]\r<br>\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r<br>\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r<br>\n:============================================================================:\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["Multiclass"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"7e530ea1-29df-43ce-a5a0-a900357bd87d","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"MULTIKILLING MULTI 'MULTI-KILLING' 'MULTIPLE DEATHS' ","HelpText":"\r\nMULTIKILLING\r<br>\nIn order to give player characters time to recover from being player-killed\r\n(PK'd), it is illegal to kill a player character a second time if they have\r\nnot had the time to completely heal from the wounds incurred from a death\r\nthat was directly caused by you.

Necromancers\r\nare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand\r\ncombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer\r\nand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between\r\nlife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to\r\nanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. \r<br>\nNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and\r\nrituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to\r\nperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a\r\nfocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,\r\nhexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects\r\nrespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer\r\nthey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the\r\nnecromancer's own blood to draw. \r<br>\nUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which\r\ntype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are\r\nskeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a\r\nnatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.\r\nWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come\r\nfrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always\r\nbeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a\r\nplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains\r\nand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that\r\nphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some\r\ninnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in\r\ncombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty\r\napparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark\r\nhood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be\r\nunderestimated in combat.

One\r\nof the first projects that Hadukk organized was designed to improve the\r\ndefenses of the outpost.  He ordered walls be built at the north and\r\nsouth ends of the valley, which would effectively seal up Nre'yth since\r\nthe steep mountain slopes to the east and west were natural barriers.\r\nWhile Vro'ath are adept at constructing walls and other military\r\nfortifications, Hadukk still hired some dwarves for help, mainly to mine\r\nbuilding materials from the nearby mountains.\r\n\tAfter the completion of the walls, Hadukk felt secure enough to\r\nallow a civilian population inside Nre'yth, as long as the residents\r\nwould accept martial rule.  Indeed, Nre'yth became a key defensive\r\nstronghold for the Vro'ath.  With adequate supplies and soldiers, Hadukk\r\nfelt that the city could endure multi-year sieges.  Also, Nre'yth lies in\r\nthe way of one of the few routes for traveling to the northern parts of\r\nthe continent.  This allowed the Vro'ath city to dominate a key trade\r\nroute to the north.\r\n\tNaturally, the humans living to the south resented the Vro'ath\r\ncontrol of a key trade route to the north. Some hotheads organized a\r\nforce to seize Nre'yth.  Knowing that a direct assault upon the walls\r\nwould be futile, the humans bribed some dwarves for help.  These dwarves\r\nshowed the humans some passages through the mines in Aven Talir and Aven\r\nTeluk which were unknown to the Vro'ath.  Coming out of these mine\r\npassages, the human attackers were able to surprise the unprepared\r\nVro'ath garrison inside the city.\r\n\tThe humans nearly seized control of Nre'yth, if not for the\r\ndiscipline of the Vro'ath soldiers, which kept them from panicking, and\r\nthe foresight of Marshal Hadukk.  Knowing that Nre'yth was located in a\r\nstrategically important spot, Hadukk had predicted an attack on the city\r\nweeks in advance and had requested reinforcements from other Vro'ath\r\nleaders.  Led by Marshal Bujaghn, the reinforcements came in time to save\r\nthe city for the Vro'ath.  Unfortunately, Bujaghn was not in time to save\r\nhis colleague Hadukk, who was killed in a ferocious, almost suicidal,\r\ncharge by a band of human knights.  The arrival of Bujaghn's forces\r\nturned the tide, and almost all the human attackers were either killed or\r\ncaptured.  The few dwarven accomplices of the humans were also caught.\r\n\tAs punishment, Bujaghn put the human and dwarven captives to work\r\nin the mines. One of their first tasks was to collapse those passages\r\nwhich would undermine the defense of the city.  Furthermore, Bujaghn\r\ndecided that he would enslave these humans for the rest of their lives.\r\nAt this point, the Vro'ath religious leaders intervened. Such an act of\r\ncruelty would only reinforce the Vro'ath \"brute\" image that other races\r\nsaw.  The Vro'ath priests worked diligently to banish such an image from\r\neveryone's eyes. However, Bujaghn would not budge in his position; he\r\nfelt that slave was more than those human captives deserved. A compromise\r\nwas reached: Bujaghn would be allowed keep his slaves, but they were to\r\nbe well treated and released after serving faithfully for five years.\r\nHowever, Bujaghn negotiated a couple important concessions from the\r\nVro'ath church leaders. First, owners of slaves were allowed to sell\r\nslaves as property.  Second, all future prisoners captured in military\r\nencounters with the Vro'ath would also be subjected to slavery.  Thus,\r\nBujaghn can be considered the founder of the Vro'ath slave trade.  He\r\nalso organized the first slave raiding parties.  These were small bands\r\nof highly trained Vro'ath soldiers who attacked frontier human\r\nsettlements or groups of unsuspecting travelers, never with the intent to\r\nkill, but only to capture humans alive.  The Vro'ath religious leaders\r\ngrumbled a bit about this, but they grudgingly ignored these acts as long\r\nas the slaves were allowed to free after five years.\r\n\tAt present, Nre'yth is still primarily a trading city, with slaves\r\nbeing the major commodity.  Slave raiders still exist, but they now\r\ninclude other races as targets for slaves.  Rule in the city is a tenuous\r\nbalance of power between the leaders of the church and the military.  The\r\ncurrent leaders of Nre'yth are Marshal Torqenuk and High Priest il'Reshaz.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["NREYTH"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"bfd4c1ba-04ee-4efb-8dde-4c86e8428d7c","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"NWO ","HelpText":"The New World Order has arrived and they're here to win back control from the filthy non-humans.

All price values are in silver.\r<br>\nSelling items:\r\n--------------\r<br>\nIn order to sell items, a shop keeper must be present.  The shopkeeper may be\r\neither the store owner, or a employee mob that can be hired using the 'hire'\r\ncommand. (Please talk to an immortal in order to gain employee mobs).

One kind is\r\na 'coder' Immortal who has been created in order to test new code.  The other\r\nkind is an Admin immortal.  Admins can be regular immortals whose sole job is\r\nto help newbies and answer questions or they may have more specialized roles\r\nsuch as being in charge of Clans, Questing or Law.\r<br>\nWhether you are a coder Immortal or one of the Admin persuasion, you are\r\nexpected to follow the guidelines found in 'help immortal laws' to the\r\nletter.  Additionally, there are a few pointers that need to be followed when\r\ndealing with the mortal population.\r<br>\n  *  When speaking to mortals, ALWAYS try your very best to be 'visible' to\r\n  the mortals you are speaking to.  There may be instances when this isn't\r\n  possible for whatever reason, but those instances should be very rare.\r<br>\n  *  As stated in 'help immortal laws' do NOT kill mortals under any\r\n  circumstances.  There may be a very rare instance where it is necessary to\r\n  slay a mortal for misbehavior, but again, this should be extremely rare.\r<br>\n  *  It is very fun to play with mortals by switching into mobs.  Be very\r\n  prepared to wind up killing mortals if you play with them by switching into\r\n  naturally aggressive mobs.  Make no mistake -- if you are switched into an\r\n  aggressive mob, you WILL wind up killing a mortal at some point as you will\r\n  not have full control over that mob's actions.  (Read above point regarding\r\n  killing mortals).   Mortals do not like being killed by Immortals under any\r\n  reason, whether they are being played with or not, with the exception of\r\n  when quests are run.  So, if you want to have fun with them, the best way\r\n  to do this is to run a quest.  By doing this you cover yourself should a\r\n  mortal die and you make points with mortals because they like quests.\r<br>\n  *  Roleplay is to be encouraged on Exodus, whether you are an Immortal\r\n  roleplaying or a mortal.  However, it has been found that Immortals\r\n  roleplaying a relationship with mortals tends to create a lot of confusion\r\n  on the MUD from a player standpoint and can even affect the Immortal\r\n  Staff as a whole in some rare instances.  For this reason please do not\r\n  roleplay relationships with mortals (which includes net sex).  You are more\r\n  than welcome to create a mortal character for this type of roleplay.\r<br>\n  *  Coder Immortals, as stated above, are in existence to test code on the\r\n  live port.  As this is so, coder immortal interaction with the mortal\r\n  population on Exodus should be kept down to a bare minimum.  It is the job\r\n  of Admin Immortals to deal with the Exodus population in matters of helping\r\n  newbies, answering questions, running quests, making sure rules are\r\n  followed, and other related issues.\r<br>\n  *  If a mortal writes to you specifically, please respond to them in a\r\n  prompt fashion if their note requires a response.  Not responding to\r\n  notes written specifically to you is a huge irritant to the mortal\r\n  population as a whole.  It's simply a matter of courtesy.  If you wrote to\r\n  them about a question or an important matter, you would expect a prompt\r\n  reply (if they were logged on).  So please, try to respond to your notes as\r\n  soon as conveniently possible.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["Public Relations"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"d332f5b7-2bab-43e5-b6b4-defc3aba177b","LevelAccess":92,"Keywords":"PUNISHMENTS ","HelpText":"These are guidelines for punishments based on what we have been giving\r\nfor common offenses.

Attempts at communication with the\r<br>\nrace have, for the most part, failed.  Successful communication with\r<br>\nelder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of\r<br>\nknowledge of  WHY the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.

To go further\r<br>\nand pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.  Not only is their\r<br>\nphilsophic stance untenable, their willingness to sacrifice themselves\r<br>\nfor Ayvyron is indicative of extremely psychological instability.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nOutwardly, House Jhereg seeks to control Thesden.

Just as the\r<br>\nPaladin serves the forces of good in the world, the Reaver is the\r<br>\ncounterpart, black-hearted swordsman.  The manifestation of the\r<br>\nReavers faith is the blade they wield the symbol of their cult.  The\r<br>\nReavers are based entirely around the blade, which is the only weapon\r<br>\nthey are allowed to wield.  This blade has a mind of its own and is as\r<br>\nmuch a part of the reaver as any other limb.  As the Reaver grows in\r<br>\npower, so does his blade.  By capturing the souls of the slain, a reaver\r<br>\nmay feed the dark will of his blade and gain power through it.  Soul\r<br>\nenergies of the slain are sacrificed into the blade like a type of\r<br>\ncurrency.  It is said that the developed blade in the hands of a skilled\r<br>\nreaver is a potentially unlimited force.  Reavers may also store spells\r<br>\nwithin the sword to be summoned forth at a time of their choosing.  A\r<br>\nReaver who strays even slightly onto the realm of goodness is rebuked\r<br>\nby his weapon, which abandons him until he returns to the path of\r<br>\ndarkness.  Note: Reavers have special commands involving their swords. \r<br>\n<sword options> shows what commands you may perform involving the sword. \r<br><br><br>\nSome sword commands may be performed anywhere and some must be performed\r<br>\nin the dark sanctuary of the Reaver guild hall.  All sword upgrades must be\r<br>\nperformed in the dark sanctuary.  The same is true for all blade and burst\r<br>\nspells, which can only be cast upon the sword at the altar of annihilation.\r<br>\nOnce spells are stored in the sword, they may be invoked anywhere.  The\r<br>\nduration of blade spells and the effect of burst spells is directly related\r<br>\nto the alignment of the Reaver--the more evil the Reaver, the greater the\r<br>\neffect.  When a Reaver dies, he must return to the dark altar in order to\r<br>\ninvoke his sword again, although any spells and upgrades will stay in the\r<br>\nsword.  Soul Energies (SE) are reaped from mobs based on their level and\r<br>\nalignment.  Angelic mobs and more powerful mobs will give more SE.  Reaver\r<br>\nblades are open-ended, meaning there is no cap on the power one can imbue\r<br>\nhis blade with, although the cost of upgrading the blade increases\r<br>\ndramatically as the blade becomes more powerful.  Combat upgrades fall into\r<br>\nfour categories: Power, Hatred, Fury, and Strength.  Raising the Power of\r<br>\nyour blade will moderately increase the damage your blade can inflict,\r<br>\nalthough you may not notice right away.  Hatred is a more dramatic and\r<br>\nobvious upgrade, but it is also more expensive.  Fury refers to the vigor\r<br>\nwith which the Reaver attacks the target.  Improving Fury will give you a\r<br>\nbetter chance of hitting your opponent.  Blade Strength is another aspect\r<br>\nwhich determines the damage done by your Reaver blade.  Try upgrading each\r<br>\nof them in turn to keep your sword balanced.  Before you can store a blade\r<br>\nspell in your blade, you must upgrade the sword to contain a slot for it. \r<br>\nYou may buy more than one slot of each type of blade spell, although the\r<br>\ncost goes up each time.  Once you have purchased a slot for a blade spell,\r<br>\nyou may go to the altar of annihilation and chant the appropriate blade or\r<br>\nburst spell.  If successful, it will be stored in the blade and will appear\r<br>\nin <sword options>.  Once the spell is stored, you may invoke it at any\r<br>\ntime.  When you invoke the blade spell, you do not lose the slot in your\r<br>\nblade�- it just becomes empty until you return to the altar and store\r<br>\nanother spell in the blade.\r<br><br><br>\nSKILLS\r<br>\nLevel  1: shield block, sword\r<br>\nLevel  5: trip, butcher\r<br>\nLevel  7: invocation, kick\r<br>\nLevel 10: disarm, parry, fast healing, fishing\r<br>\nLevel 12: rescue\r<br>\nLevel 15: second attack\r<br>\nLevel 16: door bash\r<br>\nLevel 18: redirect\r<br>\nLevel 20: riding, dodge\r<br>\nLevel 23: repulse\r<br>\nLevel 25: swimming\r<br>\nLevel 28: tempt\r<br>\nLevel 35: enhanced damage\r<br>\nLevel 41: third attack\r<br><br><br>\nCHANTS\r<br>\nLevel  1: sense good, summon sword\r<br>\nLevel  5: sense alignment\r<br>\nLevel  7: shocking blade\r<br>\nLevel 10: unholy smirk\r<br>\nLevel 14: lightning burst\r<br>\nLevel 20: aura of evil\r<br>\nLevel 21: frost blade\r<br>\nLevel 28: ice burst\r<br>\nLevel 30: scorch metal\r<br>\nLevel 35: flaming blade\r<br>\nLevel 42: fire burst\r<br>\nLevel 49: chaotic blade\r<br>\nLevel 50: sense hidden\r<br>\nLevel 56: unholy burst\r<br>\nLevel 63: venomous blade\r<br>\nLevel 70: vampiric blade\r<br>\nLevel 77: hellscape\r<br>\n","Category":"Classes","Tags":["reaver"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"c40b65a9-f5aa-40a3-8274-05c088cca026","LevelAccess":100,"Keywords":"REBOOT SHUTDOWN ","HelpText":"Syntax: reboot\r\n\tshutdown\r<br>\nReboot shuts down the server.

It is  similar to the SQI \r<br>\n(Super Quest Item) which is earned by either questing or grinding \r<br>\nfor tokens. See help quest token and help sqi.\r<br><br><br>\nThere are some key differences between an SQI and a relic, though \r<br>\nthe general idea is still the same: A powerful, unique-to-you item \r<br>\nearned through hard work and dedication.\r<br><br><br>\nHere are the main differences:\r<br><br><br>\n- A relic starts out with 7 points as opposed to 5.\r<br>\n- A relic will never have rot_death on it. \r<br>\n- A relic must have an RP name suiting to your character.\r<br>\n- A relic must have a story behind it. (More on this later)\r<br>\n- A relic CAN be improved upon with continued exceptional RP.\r<br><br><br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br>\nHow do you earn a relic?\r<br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br><br><br>\nStart out with unfaltering roleplay. It is kosher to leave character \r<br>\nonce in a while, or even partake in a lengthy OOC discussion. \r<br>\nHowever, going OOC on IC channels (Gossip, say, etcetera) isn't a \r<br>\ngreat way to earn your relic.\r<br><br><br>\nYou're expected to have a strong RP background. A well  written \r<br>\nhistory and description is a must. Those things alone will not only \r<br>\nearn you smaller prizes respectively, but are the cornerstone of \r<br>\nearning your relic.\r<br><br><br>\nIf you're aiming for a relic, you should probably think of an item \r<br>\nthat your character would have with them all the time. It can be \r<br>\nanything - a mother's handkerchef, a blade of some sort - so long \r<br>\nas it fits into your roleplay. We expect you to know what the item \r<br>\nis going to be by the time we tell you that we feel you're ready for \r<br>\na relic. If you don't already  know, we'll ask you to take some more \r<br>\ntime and think about it. A couple short paragraphs on how your \r<br>\ncharacter acquired the relic are also required, if they aren't \r<br>\nalready written into your history.\r<br><br><br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br>\nSo how long will it take you to earn one?\r<br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br><br><br>\nIn addition to your history, plan, and the explanation of where your \r<br>\nrelic came from, we are looking for a player who is dedicated to \r<br>\ntheir character's role. We will be checking to make sure people are \r<br>\nstaying in character. A person with a relic is meant to set an \r<br>\nexample for other roleplayers, so these won't be  given out lightly. \r<br>\nIt could take you as short as a month or  as long as a year, \r<br>\ndepending on how long it takes you to develop your character and how\r<br>\nstrong your roleplaying skills are.\r<br><br><br>\nOnce we decide that you are ready for a relic, the immortal staff\r<br>\nwill hold a meeting to make sure we're all on the same page, and \r<br>\nthen we will be asking around to other players on whether or not\r<br>\nTHEY feel like you've brought exceptional roleplay to the game.\r<br><br><br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br>\nRelics grow with you?\r<br>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br><br><br>\nYes!

Says, Gossip, Clan Talk, and emotes should ALWAYS be IC.\r<br>\n* It's not okay to use terms like Stats, HP/MANA, Leveling, AC, etcetera.\r<br>\n   Examples:\r<br>\n    X What stats are best for a mage?\r\n    * As a magic user, will I need to be overly charismatic?\r\n                \r\n    X How much mana do you have?\r\n    * Do you have a large pool of magical reserves?\r<br>\n    X Want to go leveling? I'm only level 30.\r\n    * Would you like to go hunting with me? I'm only about a third\r\n      of the way through my training.\r<br>\n    X My AC sucks, so I get hit a lot.\r\n    * My armor isn't the best, so I'm easily hit.\r<br>\n* Do not force roleplay. This is probably the worst thing you can do.\r<br>\n    Examples:\r\n     X emote slaps you and you cower in a corner.\r\n     * emote slaps you and fixes you with an icy stare.\r\n               \r\n       Never take the control of someone's character away from them.\r\n       A level 90 Kalian Reaver for instance, likely wouldn't 'cower'\r\n       over anything. That's not for you to say. You do the action,\r\n       NEVER, EVER, EVER the reaction.\r<br>\n* The gossip channel should be a tool for an RP character, not a go-to.\r<br>\n    Examples:\r\n   X Oh, hi someone. It's nice to see you again.\r\n    (Take it to tells or find them in game.)\r\n    * Is anyone interested in hunting with me?\r<br>\n   There are exceptions to this rule. I've seen some pretty awesome RP\r\n   go down on the gossip channel, and I've seen some RP that just doesn't\r\n   belong there. In time, you will learn the difference. At the beginning,\r\n   you should just stay away from it unless you NEED to ask a public\r\n   question.\r<br>\n* Grammar and spelling is important. Yes, I'm going to go here. In the past,\r\n  I've said that having poor spelling/grammar is the MUD analogue of having\r\n  a severe speech impediment in real life. I was immediately countered with\r\n  'Who are you to tell me my character doesn't!' - Okay, fair argument. Your\r\n  character may have a speech impediment, fine. But think of how such a thing\r\n  might be presented in a fantasy novel. Could you read a book if every other\r\n  word was misspelled? Just keep that in mind.\r<br>\nAll in all, RP is about taking on a completely different mindset. What that\r\nis, is completely up to you and how you want your character to act. The best\r\nway to get into it initially is to simply pretend you're in medieval times.\r\nBe a child for a while, use your imagination. Anything that doesn't make\r\nsense to someone who lived in a castle hundreds of years ago shouldn't make\r\nsense to your character - grant me some lenience here with magic.\r<br>\n:============================================================================:\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["roleplay"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"1ec38af4-e135-4a0c-a679-12a1795cbe6a","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"ROM ","HelpText":"\r\nROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code.

Thus, in order\r\n     to set up a room as a shop, you must create a mobile that will\r\n     act as shopkeeper.  In the mobile editor (medit), there is a command\r\n     'shop' that lets you set values that will determine how the shop\r\n     will function.  The shop command has four arguments: hours,\r\n     profit, type and delete.  Using the 'hours' argument with shop\r\n     allows you to set what type the shop opens and closes.  \r\n     The syntax is: 'shop hours [open-hour] [close-hour]'.  The times here\r\n     are in 24-hour format.  So for a shop to open at 9 am and close at\r\n     5 pm, the command would be 'shop hours 9 17'.  For a shop that is \r\n     always open, use 'shop hours 0 23'.  Using the 'profit' argument with\r\n     shop allows you to set the markups on object cost for buying and \r\n     selling.  To buy and sell products at-cost, these markup values\r\n     should be set to 100 (100% of cost).  The syntax is:\r\n     'shop profit [buy-profit] [sell-profit]'.  If you wanted to create\r\n     a shopkeeper that would sell object at 120% of cost (20% more than\r\n     their actual cost value) and buy objects at-cost, the command used\r\n     would be 'shop profit 120 100'.  Using the 'type' argument with\r\n     the shop command allows you to set which types of objects this\r\n     shop keeper will buy and sell.  Up to 5 (0-4) different object types\r\n     can be traded.   The syntax is: shop type [0-4] [item type].\r\n     So, for a shop that would be trading weapons and armor, two commands\r\n     would be used:  'shop type 0 weapon', 'shop type 1 armor'.  Valid\r\n     object types for this command are: Light, Scroll, Wand, Staff, Weapon\r\n     Treasure, Armor, Potion, Clothing, Furniture, Container, Drink Container,\r\n     Boat, Pill, Map, Portal, Warpstone, Gem, Jewelry.\r\n     The 'delete' argument for shop allows you delete item types you\r\n     have previously set.  For example, to convert the previous shop to\r\n     armor-only, the command would be 'shop delete 0'.  \r\n     \r<br>\n  + Stocking the shop\r<br>\n     In order to give the shop items, you must reset these item into\r\n     the shop keeper's inventory.  (Please see the RESETS section of this \r\n     document for more information.)\r<br><br>\n  + Creating a pet shop or a stable\r<br>\n     Pet shops and stables are special shop types.  In order to create\r\n     these kinds of shops you must have two consecutive vnum-ed rooms free.\r\n     If you wanted to use room vnum '5000' as a pet shop or a stable, then\r\n     room vnum '5001' would have to be created.  '5001' acts as a \r\n     'back room' for the pet shop or stable, and it's where all the animals\r\n     are held.  Back rooms for pet shops or stables should _not_ \r\n     be linked to other rooms under normal circumstances.\r\n     The store-front room (5000, here) should be flagged as either\r\n      'pet_shop' or 'stable' using the 'room' command from the room editor.\r\n     Example: edit room 5000\r\n              room pet_shop\r\n     Once this room is created, a shopkeeper mob should be created as normal\r\n     (see above).  This shopkeeper should then be set to reset into the\r\n     store-front room (5000 in this example).  All the pets or mounts\r\n     this shopkeeper can sell should then be set up with mob resets in \r\n     the back-room (5001, here.).\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["SHOPKEEPER"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"bd98c53a-934b-4c0f-8f1c-2ed092b1228b","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"shuffle ","HelpText":"syntax: Shuffle \r<br>\nWhile trying to show off his ability to fancifully shuffle a deck of cards a voice \r<br>\nsends him into a fit of rage and cards fly everywhere, hitting multiple targets in \r<br>\nthe room, some more than once depending on how many cards he has in his possession.\r<br><br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["shuffle"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"67277264-8baf-42bf-90c7-ea5e9b858490","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"SIDHE ","HelpText":"Though recognized as the common ancestor of drow and elves, the sidhe are\r\nalso direct predecessors of pixies, sylphs, and sprites.

The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r<br>\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r<br>\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r<br>\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r<br>\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r<br>\nwas restored to all its glory.\r<br>\n  \r<br>\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r<br>\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r<br>\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r<br>\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or\r<br>\nheard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Sinistral.\r<br>\n   \r<br>\n`q+PURPOSE`q+\r<br>\n   \r<br>\n\\-=`q$=-/ is the crown of Sinistral, to be worn only by the purest of evil.

They created the towns and the\r<br>\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r<br>\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r<br>\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r<br>\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r<br>\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r<br>\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r<br>\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r<br>\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r<br>\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r<br>\nwas restored to all its glory.\r<br>\n     \r<br>\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r<br>\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r<br>\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r<br>\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or\r<br>\nheard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Synn.\r<br>\n        \r<br>\n\\-=`q$=-/ is the crown of Synn, to be worn only by the purest of evil.

He tried to wear the crown, \r<br>\nbut was zapped by its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood \r<br>\nand filth, weary but still able to recal what had happened. On his hand was a burned engraved  \r<br>\nimage of the crown. He was shortly transported away, and back into Thesden. Later that night \r<br>\nhe heard a voice in dream. The voice told him that he was given a gift. That he would be the one \r<br>\nto find the true evil. The voice told him to find others, and to kill all those who opposed him.\r<br>\nThus began his quest to find the one who can bring pure evil among the world.\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["Synn"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"ee1a85c1-0797-4eb6-87c4-d33291467825","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"SYVIN ","HelpText":"The Syvin race is very similar to elves, in fact they are distant cousins.\r\nAs lovers of nature, they respect all animals, and only hunt for survival\r\npurposes.

These dreams haunted\r<br>\nthe few Vro'ath who still had honor.... who were still true warriors of the\r<br>\nholy Ne'Shajh.  The great Ne'Shajh himself flitted through these \r<br>\ndreams, telling the Vro'ath where they had gone wrong... what they should do \r<br>\nto fix this.  He showed them how they had been blinded by money and personal\r<br>\npower.  They no longer worked for the greater good of the Vro'ath people! \r<br>\nthese dreams came most strongly to one Vro'ath, the Vro'ath know as Arith.\r<br>\nNe'Shajh made Arith remember that day, the day that Arith's family had\r<br>\nbeen burned alive by an unforseen attack by elves.  He made Arith remember\r<br>\nthe searing pain as Arith was consumed in fire.  He made Arith remember \r<br>\nthat Arith lived only because of a boon granted by him.  Ne'Shajh told Arith \r<br>\nthat his life had not been spared so that he could become a slaver.  Arith was\r<br>\nto work for the greater good of the Vro'ath people!  Because of these dreams,\r<br>\nArith made a pilgramage to Nre'yth, home of the Vro'ath. \r<br>\n  \r<br>\nWhen Arith arrived at the ancient city he was appaled at the corruption that\r<br>\nwas at the very heart of the city.

The people of Thesden agreed to leave a\r\nlarge portion of the forests west of Thesden unharvested, to help\r\ndefend the forests against attackers, and to assist the elves with food\r\nand any other aid they needed.

It\r<br>\nis said that the ocean holds fish of all sizes, including several legendary\r<br>\nfish, which nobody really knows to exist.\r<br><br><br>\nIn order to properly fish for a trophy fish, one must first get a fishing pole.\r<br>\nThe appropriate fishing pole can be purchased from the Emporium in Freeport.\r<br>\nNext you need some bait.  Every fisherman knows the best bait is a can of\r<br>\nworms, which can be found in Ebon Downs at the Fish and Tackle shop.  Be\r<br>\nsure to buy PLENTY of bait, because you probably won't catch a legendary fish\r<br>\non your first try.\r<br><br><br>\nAfter procuring the necessary equipment, it's time to head to sea.  Those who\r<br>\nare excellent swimmers can strike out on their own, while others may choose\r<br>\nto charter a boat.  Either way, sail out into the salty blue until you find a\r<br>\nspot you like.  There are several hot spots for fishing in the ocean and you\r<br>\ncan never be completely sure where one will be, so if you fish for a while and\r<br>\nonly come up with little fish, it may be time to move on to another spot.  The\r<br>\ncloser you get to a hot spot, the larger the variance in the size of the fish.\r<br><br><br>\nSo, when you have found a spot, the next step is to [hold pole] and then\r<br>\n[bait line] using your bait.  Finally, [cast line] to start fishing.  Wait a\r<br>\nlittle while to see if you get a hit.  Typically, a chance for a nibble comes\r<br>\naround a couple times a minute.  You can [reel line] to attempt to entice the\r<br>\nfish around you to take a bite.  Eventually, you will feel a tug on your line.\r<br>\nWhen this happens, it's decision time.  You can [reel line] to try to hook the\r<br>\nfish.  If it's a smaller fish, reeling right away will have a better chance of\r<br>\nhooking it.  For larger fish, you may want to wait until you get a stronger\r<br>\npull on the line or else you might scare it away.  With a little skill and\r<br>\nluck, you will hook the fish.\r<br><br><br>\nOnce you've hooked the fish, you need to fight it to bring it in.  You will\r<br>\nsee the line zig through the water.  When the line tension shows up as ***\r<br>\nyou should [reel line] and wait a few seconds.  When line tension is *** it's\r<br>\ntime to [reel slacken] so that you don't snap the line.  Larger fish will\r<br>\nfight more than smaller fish, so get ready for a challenge.  If all goes\r<br>\nwell, you will eventually reel in the fish and have your prize.  If you\r<br>\nlose your bait or just feel like starting over, you can [reel all] to\r<br>\nstart over.\r<br><br><br>\nSo why would anyone want to put up with all this nonsense just to catch a\r<br>\nsilly fish?  Money and prestige.  Trophy fish can sell for incredible amounts\r<br>\nof money.  Even the smallest fish sell for a few gold.  Larger fish over 200\r<br>\npounds can sell in the thousands of gold.  It is said that legendary fish\r<br>\ncan sell for as much as 15,000 gold, although they are rarely caught unless\r<br>\nthe fisherman has the good fortune to zero in on a hotspot.  Some legendary\r<br>\nfish even have their own names and reputations from those who have seen them\r<br>\nand lived to escape.  Worth even more than the money prize is the bragging\r<br>\nrights.  The heaviest catches will be recorded for posterity in the fishing\r<br>\nhall of fame.\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["trophy","fishing"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"d8d08351-2092-4ff1-bfb4-94e2c4fd6d17","LevelAccess":0,"Keywords":"'TRUE SIGHT' ","HelpText":"Syntax: pray 'true sight'\r<br>\nTrue sight is a prayer which allows the devout to see even those\r\nmagically shrouded with invisibility.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["TRUE SIGHT"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"d29680bb-9177-4225-99ed-e566379d665f","LevelAccess":100,"Keywords":"TRUST ","HelpText":"Syntax: trust <character> <level>\r<br>\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r<br>\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r<br>\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r<br>\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r<br>\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r<br>\n| tire Vro'ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r<br>\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r<br>\n| together in the name of the great god Ne'Shajh, and united under the    |\r<br>\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r<br>\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro'ath |\r<br>\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r<br>\n| `reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r<br>\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r<br>\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r<br>\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r<br>\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r<br>\n| `side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r<br>\n| the name of Ne'Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r<br>\n|                                                                         |\r<br>\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r<br>\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r<br>\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne'Shajh  |\r<br>\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro'ath race as the dominant race    |\r<br>\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r<br>\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro'ath race is superior to all others, | \r<br>\n| d that only the Vro'ath deserve to rule.  The only race tolerable to  |\r<br>\n| the Varruk is the Dwarves, due to their greed and ability to build and  |\r<br>\n| `reate great temples and monuments.  All other races are treated with   |\r<br>\n| sgust and distrust, and are assossiated with as little possible.      |\r<br>\n|  The clan is led by a council, headed by the Leader and with a          |\r<br>\n| representative of each faction having a seat upon it.  Since the        |\r<br>\n| `actions within the clan often have different goals and ideas on how    |\r<br>\n| to conqour the realm, there are often quarrels and turmoil within the   |\r<br>\n| an between members of the different factions; and due to the fact     |\r<br>\n| that the leadership positions are positions held by strength alone,     |\r<br>\n| `ssassination attemps and coups are not uncommon within the upper ranks |\r<br>\n| `f the clan.                                                            |\r<br>\n|                               Requirments                               |\r<br>\n| The following requirements must be met in order to join Varruk          |\r<br>\n| Race:Vro'ath.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r<br>\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r<br>\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r<br>\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r<br>\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r<br>\n| tire Vro'ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r<br>\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r<br>\n| together in the name of the great god Ne'Shajh, and united under the    |\r<br>\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r<br>\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro'ath |\r<br>\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r<br>\n| `reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r<br>\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r<br>\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r<br>\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r<br>\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r<br>\n| `side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r<br>\n| the name of Ne'Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r<br>\n|                                                                         |\r<br>\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r<br>\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r<br>\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne'Shajh  |\r<br>\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro'ath race as the dominant race    |\r<br>\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r<br>\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro'ath race is superior to all others, | \r<br>\n| d that only the Vro'ath deserve to rule.  The only race tolerable to  |\r<br>\n| the Varruk is the Dwarves, due to their greed and ability to build and  |\r<br>\n| `reate great temples and monuments.  All other races are treated with   |\r<br>\n| sgust and distrust, and are assossiated with as little possible.      |\r<br>\n|  The clan is led by a council, headed by the Leader and with a          |\r<br>\n| representative of each faction having a seat upon it.  Since the        |\r<br>\n| `actions within the clan often have different goals and ideas on how    |\r<br>\n| to conqour the realm, there are often quarrels and turmoil within the   |\r<br>\n| an between members of the different factions; and due to the fact     |\r<br>\n| that the leadership positions are positions held by strength alone,     |\r<br>\n| `ssassination attemps and coups are not uncommon within the upper ranks |\r<br>\n| `f the clan.                                                            |\r<br>\n|                               Requirments                               |\r<br>\n| The following requirements must be met in order to join Varruk          |\r<br>\n| Race: Vro'ath, Dwarf                                                    |\r<br>\n| Alignment: Evil                                                         |\r<br>\n| Class: Warrior, Cleric, Mage                                            |\r<br>\n| Level: Preferably 20+ but will be accepted at 10 or higher              |\r<br>\n|                                                                         |\r<br>\n| After being accepted into the clan, you must choose one of the factions |\r<br>\n| or if you are ambitious you can get other Varruk together and create    |\r<br>\n| your own faction within the clan.                                       |\r<br>\n+-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-+\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["Vigilante"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"b73962a0-3411-465a-ac8a-d2d011c14484","LevelAccess":0,"Keywords":"VISIBLE ","HelpText":"VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,\r\nmaking you visible again.\r\n","Category":null,"Tags":["VISIBLE"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"58acabd8-ac92-4cb1-ad26-d33b037abf10","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"Vistram ","HelpText":"After the Eclipse of Souls, a group of Paladins, Priests and Magi banded together to form the\r<br>\nAzurian Purgers.

The create command creates the file with you as it's owner\r\nand then puts you into the editing menu so that you can make changes\r\nto this new vocabulary file (See B.  Editing existing vocabulary files).\r<br><br>\nB.  Editing existing vocabulary files.\r<br>\n    In order to edit a vocabulary file that already exists, type\r\n\"edit <filename>\" from the vocabulary file editor's main menu.  You\r\nmust be the original creator of the vocabulary file (or an extremely\r\nhigh level immortal) in order to make changes.  Once the command\r\nto edit this file has been entered, you will be placed in the editing\r\nsub-menu, which allows you to list the lines in the file, delete lines\r\nfrom the file and add new lines to the file.\r<br>\n    1.  Adding new vocabulary entries into this file.\r<br>\n\tTo add a new vocabulary trigger, type \"add\" from the editing\r\n        sub-menu.  You will be asked for four pieces of information,\r\n        on at a time.  The first thing you will be asked for is a list\r\n        of trigger words that will set off this trigger.  The list\r\n        can be any number of words, seperated by '&' (AND) or '|' (OR).\r\n\tThese logical operators determine which word(s) are needed\r\n        in a say or tell to the mobile.  For example, if you entered\r\n        'who&are&you' here, the words who AND are AND you would all\r\n        have to appear in the text for this trigger to be activated.\r\n        If you entered 'who|what&are&you' then the words who OR what\r\n        AND are AND you would have to appear ('who are you' would trigger\r\n        this text, and 'what are you' would also trigger this text.\r\n        Or operators ('|') are resolved before ang operators ('&')\r\n\tso \"what&this|that&is\" would be triggered by \"what is that\" and\r\n        \"what is this\", but not by \"what this that\" or \"is that\", etc.\r\n\tAfter you enter this list of words, you will be prompted for\r\n        a value representing the mood(s) in which this trigger\r\n\tshould work (see: help moods).  There are 7 moods, though\r\n        0 is reserved for non-smart-mobs.  Generally 4 is a neutral mood,\r\n\tlower than 4 is progressively more unhappy and greater than 4\r\n \tis progressively more happy.  Valid values for this entry include\r\n\tthings like '3' (if mood is 3, this trigger is valid),\r\n\t'>4' (if mood is greater than (but NOT equal to) 4, than this \r\n\ttrigger is valud), '<7' (if mood is less than 7, this trigger\r\n\tis valid).  The next value you must enter represents how the\r\n\tmob's mood should be offset if this trigger is hit.  This\r\n\tvalue can be a number, such as '6' (if this trigger is hit,\r\n\tautomatically set mob's mood to 6), an increment, such\r\n\tas '+2' (if this trigger is hit, add 2 to the mob's mood),\r\n\ta decrement, such as '-1' (if this trigger is hit, subtract 1\r\n\tfrom the mob's mood), or '-' which signifies that this trigger\r\n\tshould not affect the mob's mood at all.\r\n\tThe last piece of information you need to supply is what the \r\n\tmob should say and do when this trigger is hit.  If the mob\r\n\tsees this text in a say, it will respond in a say; if it sees\r\n\tit in a tell, it will respond in a tell.  Multiple lines\r\n\tmay be seperated by the semicolon (;).  A special keyword,\r\n\tCMD, may be used to make the mob enter regular mud commands.\r\n\tFor example, entering \"Hi, I am a mob!\" would cause the mob\r\n\tto say \"Hi, I am a mob!\" when this trigger is met.\r\n\tEntering \"I am really mad; CMD frown\" would cause the\r\n\tmob to say \"I am really mad\" and then execute the command\r\n\t'frown'.\r\n\tThere are a number of special variables (that represent information\r\n\tabout the character that tripped the trigger) that may appear in this\r\n\ttext, they are:\r<br>\n\t\t$name   - Replace with character's name\r\n\t\t$area   - Replace with area name of area character is in\r\n\t\t$room   - Replace with room name of room character is in\r\n\t\t$level  - Replace with character's current level\r\n\t\t$race   - Replace with character's race name\r\n\t\t$clan   - Replace with character's clan name\r\n\t\t$class  - Replace with character's class name\r\n\t\t$time   - Replace with current (game) time\r\n\t\r\n\tFor example, if you created a trigger text of \"what&time&is&it\",\r\n\tyou may want to make a respond test of \"Thanks for asking $name,\r\n\tit is $time!\"  Assuming character \"Bob\" said \"what time is it?\"\r\n\tto the mobile using this vocabulary entry at 7 pm (game time), \r\n\tthe mobile would respond \"Thanks for asking, Bob, it is 7 o'clock pm!\"\r\n\tThese variables can be used with the CMD commands too, so\r\n\ta valid response text could be \"I have had enough of you.; CMD kill\r\n\t$name\".  \r<br>\n        SPECIAL TRIGGER TEXT:  When you are adding vocabulary\r\n        triggers, rather than input a list of words at the first prompt\r\n\tyou may also enter one of two special triiger texts.  The first\r\n\tis 'DEFAULT' (note: Unlike most of the vocabulary trigger\r\n\twords, DEFAULT is case-sensitive and must always be entered\r\n\tin uppercase).  You may have as many 'DEFAULT' lines in a \r\n\tvocabulary file as you want, and these lines are used when someone\r\n\ttalks to a mob but the mob finds no regular matches within\r\n\tit's vocabulary list.  If you have more than one DEFAULT, one\r\n        will be chosen randomly when a character speaks to a mobile using\r\n        words it doesn't understand.  You may want to bait the character into\r\n\ta conversational topic of your choosing by using DEFAULT entries\r\n\tthat greet the character, and leak some information that the\r\n\tmob is prepared to talk about.  The second special trigger text\r\n\tis 'INCLUDE' (also uppercase-only).  INCLUDE allows you to\r\n\t'stack' vocabulary files on top of each other.  When you enter\r\n\tthe INCLUDE trigger text, you will only be asked for the filename\r\n\tof a vocabulary file to stack into the one you are editing.  \r\n\tNested includes (INCLUDE a file that also INCLUDES another file)\r\n\tare allowed, up to 5 levels.  After 5 levels, nesting is halted\r\n\tto avoid any possible infinite recursion loops (one file INCLUDEs\r\n\tanother, which INCLUDEs the first, etc.)  When the vocabulary\r\n        files are stacked, the mob will go through the word lists in \r\n\teach trying to find matches.\r<br><br>\n    2. Listing currently defined vocabulary entries\r<br>\n\tTo list the vocabulary entries you have already added to this\r\n\tparticular vocabulary file, type \"list\", and a list (with line\r\n\tnumbers) will be given.\r<br>\n    3.  Deleting vocabulary entries\r<br>\n        To delete a specific vocabulary entry, type \"delete <line#>\"\r\n\tto delete the \"<line#>\" line.  Line numbers may be determined\r\n\tby using the list command and using the number that appears\r\n\ton the far left.\r<br>\nC.

Werecreatures  have the ability  to shift into their beastial\r<br>\nform, and back, without any harm  done to themselves or others*. In fact, \r<br>\nwhen a  werecreature is shifted,  they tend  to be much stronger  than their\r<br>\nnormal selves.  Each race becomes  a different  were creature.  Remort races \r<br>\nare  excluded,  considered to be  much more powerful  than the  regular weak \r<br>\nraces,  they are immune to the were gene unless it was possessed before they \r<br>\nremorted.  During a normal race's leveling experience, each level promotes a\r<br>\nfraction of a  chance that the race  will become either a were creature or a \r<br>\nwere hunter.  A were hunter is one  who has a devine sense  for sniffing out \r<br>\nwere creatures.  Were creatures and were hunters can sense each other, other \r<br>\npeople cannot. Were hunters,  unlike the creatures  which they hunt,  do not \r<br>\ndiffer in   their abilities  from race to race, they each possess three like \r<br>\nskills: Sense Were, Calm were and cleanse were.\r<br><br>\n* Occassionally,  the moon will force  the inner beast of a were creature to \r<br>\n  emerge,  during this time the  were creature loses all sense of self for a \r<br>\n  moment, and may or may not attack a fellow player in the room. \r<br>\nWhat do the were hunter skills do?\r<br>\nA were hunter  will always be able to detect the presence of a were creature \r<br>\nin the room, while they may not always be able to sense exactly which person \r<br>\nhas the were gene,  they can often  find out  through process of elimination. \r<br>\nIf you are a nopk were creature, do not worry,  the were hunter can not kill\r<br>\nyou. However,  he can  'calm' you,  and  put you to sleep  using  his unique \r<br>\nknowledge  of taming  the were creature.  Once  you  are put to sleep he can \r<br>\n'cleanse'  you,  causing you to be  one step closer  to being healed of your\r<br>\nwere gene.  the were hunter cannot cleanse you more than once a day. However,\r<br>\nthree such  cleanses  will completely  heal you  and you will no longer be a\r<br>\nwerecreature.\r<br>\nHow powerful are detect were and detect hunter?\r<br>\nThe werecreatures ability to sense  they are in danger is much  stronger than \r<br>\nthe  hunters  ability  to sense  who they hunt.  While a hunter  can feel the \r<br>\nwerecreatures presense if they are in the same room, a werecreature can sense\r<br>\na hunter as soon as he or she enters their realm of existance.  Like the were \r<br>\nhunters  however,  a were creature will not  know who is out to  cleanse them,\r<br>\nonly that they are present.\r<br>\nSo, what were creatures can each race become?\r<br>\nFor this, I have contructed a chart.\r<br>\n+=============================================================================+\r<br>\n| Race      |  Beast          |  Resistances             |  Vulnerabilities   |\r<br>\n+=============================================================================+\r<br>\n| Elf       | Lynx            |  Slash                   |  Pierce            |\r<br>\n| Syvin     | Panther         |  Magic                   |  Slash             |\r<br>\n| Dwarf     | Wolverine       |  Slash, Bash             |  Pierce, Lightning |\r<br>\n| Canthi    | Sea Devil       |  Magic                   |  Fire              |\r<br>\n| Sidhe     | Condor          |  Pierce                  |  Bash              |\r<br>\n| Litan     | Dragon          |  Magic                   |  Bash              |\r<br>\n| Vro'ath   | Boar            |  Magic                   |  Bash              |\r<br>\n| Human     | Wolf            |  Magic                   |  Slash             |\r<br>\n| All       | Were Hunter     |  None                    |  None              |\r<br>\n+=============================================================================+\r<br>\nOOC FACTS:\r<br>\n** Were Hunters will get a special prize each time they cleanse a were creature. A \r<br>\n   were hunter will always be a were hunter - They cannot be cleansead or rid of this\r<br>\n   knowledge that the creatures are dangerous. \r<br>\n** Were creatures can not speak while they are shifted. They have the power to shift \r<br>\n   back and forth at will, unless the shift is forced by the moons.\r<br>\n** All were creatures possess the same weakness to silver.\r<br>\n** Each were creature possesses a different set of skills depending on his or her race. \r<br>\n   If you are a wear creature, typing 'learn' will show you these skills. To learn them, \r<br>\n   you must have 1 million experience and 1000 gold for each.\r<br>\n** The chance to become a werecreature or werehunter is VERY slim. About .05% per level. \r<br>\n   If you do get the weregene, you will be notified. Once you hit 90, if you still do not\r<br>\n   have the weregene, you never will.\r<br>\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r<br>\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r<br>\n:============================================================================:\r<br>\n","Category":null,"Tags":["were"],"RelatedTags":[]},{"Id":"289b9f18-380c-4baa-822a-e65631c8b66a","LevelAccess":-1,"Keywords":"west ","HelpText":"@}-'-,--   Clan Greenwood --,-'-{@ \r<br>\nClan Greenwood is a clan of Good/Neutral players who are devoted to nature such as Rangers and Syvins.
