We came to Thesden seeking a \u003Cbr\u003Ebetter life, and greater opportunities. We had all heard of grand Thesden \u003Cbr\u003Ewith its streets of gold. Upon our arrival at the grat city, however, we \u003Cbr\u003Efound the stories of Thesden\u0027s grandeur to be misleading at best. Thesden, \u003Cbr\u003Ewhatever it once might have been, is now crumbling into decay. \u003Cbr\u003EBandits roam the streets freely, while the town guard looks on unconcerned. \u003Cbr\u003EDangerous creatures roam the lands around Thesden as well, waiting to devour \u003Cbr\u003Ethe unwary traveler. Even so refugees from other lands come to Thesden \u003Cbr\u003Edaily seeking a new life. More often than not, they are easy prey for \u003Cbr\u003Epredators inside and outside the city\u0027s walls. The aristocracy, for some \u003Cbr\u003Ereason, seems to ignore these ills. The problems of society are ignored at \u003Cbr\u003Ebest by the ruling class. At worst, the nobles of the day care nothing for \u003Cbr\u003Ethose under their rule, and crush them down with oppressive edicts and \u003Cbr\u003Etaxes. We, of Clan Advocation, pledge to help others when we can, \u003Cbr\u003Eespecially those who are new to the lands and less able to fend for \u003Cbr\u003Ethemselves. We have foresworn violence against other clans and loners. \u003Cbr\u003EWhenever possible, we will do all we can to better the conditions of all \u003Cbr\u003Ethose who walk the path of righteousness.\u003Cbr\u003E---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERacial requirements for joining clan Advocation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E-- Human \u003Cbr\u003E-- Elf \u003Cbr\u003E-- Syvin \u003Cbr\u003E-- Canthi \u003Cbr\u003E-- Avatar\u003Cbr\u003E---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClass requirements for joining clan Advocation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E-- Paladin \u003Cbr\u003E-- Mage \u003Cbr\u003E-- Cleric \u003Cbr\u003E-- Bard \u003Cbr\u003E-- Druid\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color: white;\u0022\u003E---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther requirements for joining clan Advocation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMust be of level 50 or greater. \u003Cbr\u003EMust be willing to help others. \u003Cbr\u003EMust have basic knowledge of areas and items.\u003Cbr\u003E---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy join clan Advocation?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVery large clan hall. \u003Cbr\u003EBank in clan hall. \u003Cbr\u003ENice clan gear. \u003Cbr\u003ERegular rewards for assisting others. \u003Cbr\u003ELarge clan donation. \u003Cbr\u003EPortals in clan hall to convenient areas. \u003Cbr\u003EFree player room upon joining. \u003Cbr\u003EEarn double NH points. \u003Cbr\u003EAbility to create newbie boxes.\u003Cbr\u003E---------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOOC NOTES: \u003Cem\u003E(Important)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EClan Advocation is partially Immortal run, the clan is not for PK.

If you join clan Advocation, the alt you join with can NEVER go PK again. You may leave the clan, but will be unable to convert to pk. With this\u0026nbsp;method I hope to prevent people from joining for clan gear, and leaving to PK. The clan gear Advocation offers is the best because it\u0027s for players who will be risking their lives to help others\u0026nbsp;equip, raid or get out of a sticky situation, and will NEVER be used to get one up in PK.\u0026nbsp;Because of this, any memer of clan Advocation is also banned from Battle Royales, Super Duels, and the Arena.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color: white;\u0022\u003EThe portals in the clan hall are for getting to people in need FAST.

The city \u003Cbr\u003Eof Thesden could barely withstand the fierce onslaught of forces far superior \u003Cbr\u003Eto the armies of the humans. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe roads became unsafe. All cities were surrounded and famine spread its \u003Cbr\u003Eevil arms, embracing the people in hopelessness and despair. The Knights of the \u003Cbr\u003EArgent Lance fought bravely together with the Thesden guards to drive out \u003Cbr\u003Ethe vicious hordes, but to little avail. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENo one knows where they came from. Riding great warhorses and with lances bright \u003Cbr\u003Eand innumerable, a charge swept the outskirts of the city like a tidal wave, driving \u003Cbr\u003Eaway the vro\u0027aths and leaving destruction in its wake. Many they were, noble \u003Cbr\u003Ewith grim faces from which the orcs ran away in terror. They bore great silver \u003Cbr\u003Eshields and smote their enemy with the sheer power of their armor, their swords long \u003Cbr\u003Eand deadly with blinding rays from above. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMany vro\u0027aths fell during this first assault. The remaining few, not willing to \u003Cbr\u003Ewithdraw from their hated enemies, gathered round their banner of crimson red and \u003Cbr\u003Ewithstood their ground. The echoes of battle rang far and away. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFilled with battle lust, the Argent Lance Knights exited the city on foot to fight \u003Cbr\u003Ethe remnants of the evil army together with these unknown holy warriors. Together, \u003Cbr\u003Ethey drove the enemy away with great loss. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Holy Alliant Order thus established themselves in Thesden, and from there, great \u003Cbr\u003Ecampaigns against the vroaths were planned. Slowly the land was returned to \u003Cbr\u003Epeace, and trade began to flourish again. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn Thesden, the White Tower was constructed to house the Knights of the Alliant order, \u003Cbr\u003Ewho swore alliance to the king. Many youngsters applied as squires and apprentices \u003Cbr\u003Ein the hope of becoming paladins and priests. The order grew at an impressive rate. \u003Cbr\u003ENow... evil is spreading and the order is facing many struggles. The King was \u003Cbr\u003Eassassinated and an impostor occupies his place. The Order will not carry the will \u003Cbr\u003Eof the Assassin, so it faces prosecution. Their friendship with the Argent Lance \u003Cbr\u003Eis broken, and many of their main members have been murdered. Will the Holy Order find \u003Cbr\u003Ethe support of the Almighty to derogate the king and defeat evil once again? \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERequirements\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E--------------------------\u003Cbr\u003EIt is required that all members adopt a last name and a shield-of-arms, to be \u003Cbr\u003Esubmitted to the clan leader, as well as a detailed description.

They were \u003Cbr\u003Eambushed along the way by a horde of Varruk slave traders and were \u003Cbr\u003Ecaptured, but one of the clerics named Rowin escaped. By hiding in the \u003Cbr\u003Eforest he was able to evade his hunters and make it back to Thesden. \u003Cbr\u003EAs he fell on the Cathedral steps, he uttered the story in his last \u003Cbr\u003Ebreath. All the Holy warriors rallied and set out to rescue these\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003Epriests. When they finally caught up to the slavers, they realized \u003Cbr\u003Ethat they were outnumbered. Putting their faith in God they attacked \u003Cbr\u003Eand freed the priests. After a long and deadly battle, they arose \u003Cbr\u003Evictorious. On that day, these Clerics and Paladins formed the \u003Cbr\u003EAlliant Order in which they made a pact before God to defend the \u003Cbr\u003Einnocent, help the poor and sick, and to fight evil where ever it may \u003Cbr\u003Elie.

Not possessing the \u003Cbr\u003Estaying power or defensive capabilities of the Warrior, who prefers a \u003Cbr\u003Eface-to-face fight, the Assassin is a specialist offshoot of Thieves. The \u003Cbr\u003EAssassins trace their roots back to a secret society who split from the \u003Cbr\u003EThieves\u0027 guild long ago.

While swimming is sufficient to cross some of these areas, the larger spans of water require boats for travel. The easiest, though most expensive, way to procure a boat is through a boat seller. Boat sellers may be found in most port cities, near the water\u0027s edge. Once you buy your boat, the boat seller will supply you with a map to the dock on which your boat can be found. Once you arrive at your boat\u0027s location, you may enter the boat and begin to move it around on the water. The command used to move your boat depends upon the boat type -- boats that use sails to harness the power of the wind use the \u0027sail\u0027 command to get from place to place, while human-powered boats use the \u0027row\u0027 or \u0027paddle\u0027 command. As you move from place to place, you may take a look at the water outside your boat by typing \u0027look out\u0027. Your boat will only be able to travel in the water, and may even be restricted by the type and depth of the water you are travelling in. Most boats available in Exodus have keys that limit access to the key holder. If you dock your boat at a pier and deboard, make sure you lock the entrance so that thieves do not make off with your hard-earned transport.\u003C/p\u003E",

Once all of these are created, you should reset the mob into the shop room and reset the ctransport object onto the mob, just as with any other shopkeeper. When the player buys from the shopkeeper, he will automatically take care of creating a map to the location the boat will be put, and the boat will be put there so that the player can go use it. Please note: only one boat can exist in the world per boat (ctransport) object. So once the boatseller sells a boat, that boat will no longer be for sale from the boat-keeper until the boat is destroyed or otherwise taken out of the world. You may set a boatseller to sell more than one boat object. \u003Cbr\u003ESee also: help ITEM_CTRANSPORT\u003C/p\u003E",

    "HelpText": "\u003Cp style=\u0022color: white;\u0022\u003ESo you\u0027d like to build on Exodus? Great! Building an area is something that \u003Cbr\u003Ecrosses everyone\u0027s mind at some point. The trick is to figure out whether \u003Cbr\u003Eit\u0027s a whim or a real passion. We see players as our guests and customers. \u003Cbr\u003EPlayers are the reason we run this mud. We look at builders as our \u003Cbr\u003Eemployees and we expect a level of performance out of them. We have a \u003Cbr\u003Especial port for building, which is seperate from the live port that people \u003Cbr\u003Eplay on. The builder\u0027s port is a lonely place unless you are busy working \u003Cbr\u003Eon an area, so if you just want a character to hang out, you will be very \u003Cbr\u003Eunimpressed. Also, we need someone who we know and trust, so you have to \u003Cbr\u003Ehave played this game for a while and built up a trust with the imms. I \u003Cbr\u003Ecannot tell you how many people have walked into Exodus and asked if we\u0027re \u003Cbr\u003Ehiring builders. The first question I always ask is \u0022Have you played here?\u0022 \u003Cbr\u003EIf you have not played on Exodus, how can you understand the theme of the \u003Cbr\u003Egame and what kind of an area would be appropriate? Also, you need to be a \u003Cbr\u003Eliterate speller and have decent grammar. We don\u0027t expect everyone to hold \u003Cbr\u003Ean English degree, but Exodus prides itself in the richness of its \u003Cbr\u003Edescriptions and we would like to keep up a standard. Exodus has a great \u003Cbr\u003EOLC, but there is still a teaching process involved and we don\u0027t want to waste \u003Cbr\u003Eour time teaching someone who will build for a week and then give it up. \u003Cbr\u003ELastly and most importantly, we need to know you actually plan to build an \u003Cbr\u003Earea and not just study the game for your mortal alts on the live port. \u003Cbr\u003EYou may laugh, but people have done this in the past and it amounts to \u003Cbr\u003Echeating. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn order to be set up with an account on the builder\u0027s port, we need you to \u003Cbr\u003Edo a little homework first. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u0027s what we need you to have for us when we\u0026nbsp;start and remember that having this will help you when you start to build\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Cbr\u003E--We will need a half-page description of the area you would like to \u003Cbr\u003Ebuild. Here is your chance to shine. Impress us with the story behind \u003Cbr\u003Ethe place you want to add. Tell us about the people in it and the \u003Cbr\u003Econflicts and events. You don\u0027t need to be technical here, just let us \u003Cbr\u003Eknow that you have thought out a good well-rounded area. \u003Cbr\u003E--Prepare a general map of the area. If you\u0027d like to draw out every single \u003Cbr\u003Eroom, that\u0027s great. If you only have a simple sketch of the layout, that\u0027s \u003Cbr\u003Efine too. If it\u0027s on a sheet of paper, see if you can scan it and email it \u003Cbr\u003Eto us or post it on a website and send us the link. \u003Cbr\u003E--Write out at least five room descriptions. We want to know what it will \u003Cbr\u003Efeel like to walk through your area. \u003Cbr\u003E--Write out at least three monster descriptions. Pick your favorite mobs \u003Cbr\u003Eand really give them some depth. \u003Cbr\u003E--Figure out how many rooms you will need. This is another reason having \u003Cbr\u003Ea map is a good thing. You dont need to be exact, but be as close as \u003Cbr\u003Epossible. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf you have done all of this and you still want to build, then contact Avariel\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr\u003Eand we will talk about it. Remember, if it\u0027s not fun, then there\u0027s no point. \u003C/p\u003E",

As a result,\r\n            a conversion system has been created to get the old-style\r\n            players into the new-style system.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            When you log in, you are moved to jail, but you are not being\r\n            punished.

If you\r\n            want to stay under the old-style system and simply chat, you\r\n            may do so.  Or, if you wish to speak with an immortal before\r\n            going through conversion, you have that option as well.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            If you do go through conversion, you will receive a lump sum\r\n            of experience for your old-style levels and skills.  The higher\r\n            your various skills were, the more exp you get for each of them.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            The first thing to be aware of is that your stats have been\r\n            rerolled.  If you do not like your stats, you can reroll over\r\n            and over using the reroll command.  This command can only\r\n            be used at level 1, so once you advance, you\u0027re stuck with\r\n            your stats.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            Your character will automatically have every skill and spell/\r\n            prayer/song/chant that your class can get at 1%.  There is no\r\n            longer any need to pick and choose.  Practice points are gone\r\n            and you will practice your skills by spending experience\r\n            points.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            Training points are still here, although you can no longer\r\n            train hp/mana/move.  It\u0027s ok, though, because you can improve\r\n            them by spending exp as well, but you should not worry about\r\n            that right now.  At level 1, you have two training points.\r\n            Once you have a reroll that you like, spend you training points\r\n            on your stats.  Now you\u0027re ready to advance.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            The cost of advancing rises steadily as you go up, so you should\r\n            check your total exp after every level advancement.  For each of\r\n            the first ten levels, you will get another training point to use\r\n            on your stats.  Use them as you go so you can take advantage of\r\n            their benefits right away.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            It\u0027s important to take care when building your character because\r\n            if you spend too much exp on levels, you will not have as much\r\n            to spend on skills and spells.  Likewise, you should not rush\r\n            off and practice your skills and spells to 100% right away\r\n            because the cost of practicing rises steadily as well.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n            My suggestion would be to deal with advancing to level 10 first\r\n            and spend your training sessions along the way.  Once you are\r\n            at level 10, look at your skills and spells and start\r\n            practicing them.  they all start off very cheap and they all\r\n            end up very expensive.  Practice the ones you want to about 50%\r\n            and then check your exp to make sure you have enough.  You can\r\n            always top them off later.  After this, strike a balance\r\n            between advancing levels and practicing skills and spells.\r\n            You will notice that your final character will be nowhere near\r\n            as powerful as you were under the old system.  It\u0027s ok though,\r\n            because you will be more powerful than those who you were more\r\n            powerful than under the old system and there is so much more\r\n            possibility to grow now.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r\n:============================================================================:\r\n",

[HELP DRAMA]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo assist in the process, a guide has been created listing a number of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npopular methods by which a character can leave the world of Exodus.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) The silent goodbye, Drama Level 0. The player simply deletes the character\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand the world moves on.  While this method has the most class, it is the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrarest method used.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) The goodbye note, Drama Level 1.  The player writes a final note telling\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe world he/she is leaving and wishing friends well and wishing enemies\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nill.  An email address is often left as well.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) The cry for help, Drama Level 2.  This generally happens after a player\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas experienced a perceived injustice and has usually decided to delete\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalready, but will give the imms \u0022one last chance\u0022 by making a generally\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nunreasonable request, often on public channels.  When the request is denied,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe player will often follow step 2 or in extreme cases, step 4.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) The angry spammer, Drama Level 3.  This character has given up all hope\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof avoiding deletion and has decided to vent frustration to everyone because\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe/she has nothing to lose.  Obscinity-laced messages on OOC are often\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndelivered in rapid succession resulting in loss of public channels.  If the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nanger has not been satisfied, the angry spammer will often delete and then\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlog on an alt to continue the angry spamming.  You might think this is the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost extreme method, but sadly, there is one more type.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) The war of attrition, Drama Level 4.  This character wishes to go out\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith a bang, often utilizing methods 2, 3, or 4, but never method 1.  The\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifference is that this character wishes to hang around to witness the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\naftermath of his/her departure and therein lies the flaw.  How can you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwitness the aftermath of a departure that does not happen?  Clever\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nplayers have devised a strategy to handle this problem by staging high\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrama, then deleting, then logging on an alt to listen.  In extreme cases,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe war of attrition will continue long after everyone thinks it is over\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbecause the deleted character will show up again and either make an\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nunreasonable request, complain that others are mistreating him/her, or\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhang around and badmouth Exodus in general, perhaps hoping to catch a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnewbie who is trying out the game for the first time.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| tire Vro\u0027ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| together in the name of the great god Ne\u0027Shajh, and united under the    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro\u0027ath |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the name of Ne\u0027Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne\u0027Shajh  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro\u0027ath race as the dominant race    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro\u0027ath race is superior to all others, | \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d that only the Vro\u0027ath deserve to rule.  The only race tolerable to  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the Varruk is the Dwarves, due to their greed and ability to build and  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reate great temples and monuments.  All other races are treated with   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| sgust and distrust, and are assossiated with as little possible.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  The clan is led by a council, headed by the Leader and with a          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| representative of each faction having a seat upon it.  Since the        |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060actions within the clan often have different goals and ideas on how    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to conqour the realm, there are often quarrels and turmoil within the   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| an between members of the different factions; and due to the fact     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| that the leadership positions are positions held by strength alone,     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060ssassination attemps and coups are not uncommon within the upper ranks |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060f the clan.                                                            |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                               Requirments                               |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| The following requirements must be met in order to join Varruk          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Race: Vro\u0027ath, Dwarf                                                    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Alignment: Evil                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Class: Warrior, Cleric, Mage, Bard, Ranger                              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Level: Preferably 20\u002B but will be accepted at 10 or higher              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| After being accepted into the clan, you must choose one of the factions |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| or if you are ambitious you can get other Varruk together and create    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| your own faction within the clan.                                       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\u002B\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

He told Desrielle that it was her destiny to establish\r\u003Cbr\u003E\na clan, the likes of which had never been seen in the land before.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis clan, he said, would exist for one purpose and objective only:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n                  to be silly.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n       \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Almighty Biff saw, in his wisdom, that his children would need\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhelp accomplishing his desires for them...

First, they\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmust generally, but not strictly, be evil, as morals are bad for\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nserious silliness.

The common elements within these stories\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nstresses the isolationist nature of the Sidhe, and their mischievious\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nways.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nTimes however, have changed.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor reasons known only to the Sidhe, the creatures have been appearing\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore and more in civilized areas.  Attempts at communication with the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrace have, for the most part, failed.  Successful communication with\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nelder Sidhe have only revealed a vague sense of confusion and lack of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge of  WHY the Sidhe have begun to re-emerge.  Reknowned \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhistorian Armedius Hirinjakk has noted one consistency through this\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nchaotic migration.  They are all progressing toward the south.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        [Clan Jhereg]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe House of Jhereg formed as a response to displeasure with Clan\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nDivergent.  How any Sidhe could defile themselves to follow the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nphilosophy of a non-sidhe named Auvyron and become embroiled in the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nconflicts of the lesser races is beyond our reasoning.  To go further\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand pledge support for Auvyron is unspeakable.  Not only is their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nphilsophic stance untenable, their willingness to sacrifice themselves\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor Ayvyron is indicative of extremely psychological instability.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOutwardly, House Jhereg seeks to control Thesden.  Chaos rules Thesden.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nFerath Athanmere has ruled for over twenty years, unopposed.  The Clans\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare engaged in open warfare.

House Jhereg outwardly seeks\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwo goals - first, control crime in Thesden (thus solidfying their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nposition as an organized crime syndicate) and secondly, two over throw\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nFerath Athanmere of Castle Dunluce and seat their in the position of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npower.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        [Misc.]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcerpt from the Journal of Morian e\u0027Drien - The Grey Mouse\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay of Thunder, 23rd the Month of winter\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nChaos rules the land.

A strange city.  I shall explore.  I feel compelled.  I should\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfind others.

They created the towns and the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nforests and the oceans, and eventually the inhabitants. This included the monsters, the animals,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand most importantly, the people. People were thier most prized possession. The Immortals watched\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem mature as warriors, and as intellectuals. They witnessed the creation of clans. Clans were the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npeoples way of showing who they were, and what they believed in. This was a good thing. And then\r\u003Cbr\u003E\neverything went wrong. The people developed a hatred for the Immortals and so the Immortals began\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto punish and kill the ones they felt causes the biggest problems. Others took their own lives due\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the unfairness the felt they were given by the Immortals. Then one fateful day, sadly, Exodus\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas destroyed. The Immortals needed time to figure out where they went wrong, and how they could\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfix it. The ideas passed as fast as the time, until finally, they came to a decision, and Exodus\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas restored to all its glory.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n      \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe are now in a new age. Much like the old, yet different. The clans are stronger than ever, as is\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe relationship between Immortals and people. Goodness flourishes, and hatred and evil are shunned.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut there is a force working diligently to corrupt the happy feelings of the people, not by turning\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem against their Immortals, but by turning them against eachother. This force is not seen, or\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nheard, only felt. This force, released durring the unturning of the world, is called Synn.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n      \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\\-=\u0060q$=-/ \u0060s the crown of Synn, to be worn only by the purest of evil.

He tried to wear the crown, but was zapped\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nby its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood and filth, weary\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut still able to recal what had happened. On his hand was a burned engraved image of the crown. He\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas shortly transported away, and back into Thesden. Later that night he neard a voice in dream.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe voice told him that he was given a gift. That he would be the one to find the true evil. The\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nvoice told him to find others, and to kill all those who opposed him.

Preference will be given to Sidhe--for their natural\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrilliance, mischievous ways and innate sense of comic timing--but other\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nraces will be considered too.  No humorless holy folk, no pedants, no bores,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nno humans may be admitted to the clan under any circumstances.  People who\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nconsider themselves \u0022good\u0022 are likewise unwelcome.  To join the irrelevant\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou must define a role for yourself, in the mud and in the clan, have a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuitable description to match this role, and commit to playing it.  You must\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso pass a rigorous entrance exam.  We are especially looking for young,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nidealistic, aggressive adventurous types.  Join now, and be irrelevant.  Or\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontinue to fool yourself about your own worth, if that suits you better.  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

On the mirror port, no current alts\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         are affected by the changes they will undergo. Hell \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         Nights are always full PK, meaning that no one is safe\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         from being killed by another player. If you play an\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         Avatar, you may use it on Hell Night, if you die you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         do NOT lose your Avatar. However, the immortal will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         most likely NOT want to restore your Avatar, as for \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         you to continue to play it on a Hell Night. They will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         have a lot of other things going on, and will not have\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         time to do something like this. So it is suggested that\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         you not use an Avatar on Hell Night.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n         On Hell Night, all wishes are granted. But you do not \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         get to keep anything you recieve for free. The immortal\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         running Hell Night may or may not wish to also run quests\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         which will allow you to recieve benefits that will roll \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         over onto the active Exodus Port. All quests will and MUST\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         be altered in a way that will still post a challenge for\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         the players involved, since they will have unlimited access\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         to item editing\u0027s and enhancements. Immortals may also chose\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         to run quests, and not have the benefits roll over. If you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         participate in a quest on Hell Night and get a prize, but \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         the prize is not awarded to your standard alt on the live\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         port of Exodus, please do not whine about it unless you \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         were told explicitly that the prize would be awarded to \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         your live alt. Doing such things will result in punishment.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n         If you ask an Immortal running Hell Night for any item in \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n         the world, they must oblige.

In a perfect world, any race would be\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwelcome to join our clan, but as it is, we will not accept\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nVro\u0027ath or Sidhe in our clan to protect it from being twisted to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir evil desires.  Clerics and Paladins will be scrutinized to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake sure they are not part of the power-grabbing establishment\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the church.  Clerics and Paladins interested in Liberation\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheology are welcome.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nDecisions in this clan will be made democratically by its\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmembers.  The clan leader will have no special duties or\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npriveledges other than those of a beaurocratic nature.  If at any\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime the members of clan Libertad wish to have a new leader\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n(elected democratically, of course) the old leader must step down.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt first our activities will likely center on helping newcomers\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto Exodus become more skilled in order to reduce the power that\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nothers can have over them.  When our members grow strong, we will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegin to fight more for our ideals and stand up to gross abuses\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof power, elitism, etc.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince slavery is such a terrible problem in Exodus, we will strive\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto fight it both directly and in more subtle ways.  For this reason\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe are the sworn enemies of the Varruk clan.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOOC NOTES:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nClerics and Paladins should have something meaningful about their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrelationship to the church in Exodus in their plans to contribute\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto role-playing.  Vro\u0027ath and Sidhe are not allowed because they\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsupposed to be evil.  Most members should be good, but neutral\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalignments will be tolerated as \u0022freedom-fighters\u0022 often use\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmethods that are not very nice.  We\u0027ll try to stay away from PK\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor a while, unless we are provoked.  Loners and clanned people\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwho attack our members should not be surprised if the favor is \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nreturned, even if out of level.  In general, no member of Libertad\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nshould ever PK without just provocation (i.e. in a clan war or to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\na PK of one of our members).\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis clan will try to concentrate on role-playing.  If you don\u0027t\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncare about role-playing, and just want to kill people, please\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u0027t apply.  If you are interested and want to try to roleplay\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeing a freedom fighter, please apply!\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact Mirinara. :)\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

    "HelpText": "Immortal Inactivity\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince Exodus has been around since 1996, there are large number of immortals who\r\nhave come and gone over the years.  Many of them have deleted or been deleted,\r\nbut most of them have just faded off into the sunset, leaving their characters\r\nin a sort of stasis.  Exodus does not delete players for inactivity and immortals\r\nare treated the same way.  However, due to the nature of the powers of an\r\nimmortal character, these loose ends must be tied up in a way that minimizes the\r\nsecurity threat to Exodus in general.  Therefore, as of November 9, 2003, the\r\nimmortal council of Minax, Kalus, Iverath, Iblis, and Zeraeka have decided that\r\nthe following will happen to any immortal character who takes an unannounced\r\nleave of absense from Exodus for more than 60 calendar days:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe immortal\u0027s title will be changed to reflect the old level and current date.\r\nThe immortal\u0027s level will be reduced to 92.\r\nThe immortal will be forced wizi.\r\nIf applicable, shell access on the Claret server will be suspended.\r\n*Shinowlan, as owner of Claret, is exempt from this rule.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is not a forced permanent retirement.  If the immortal comes back after\r\na time and genuinely wishes to become an active member of the Exodus immortal\r\ncommunity, that immortal will be given the opportunity to earn the levels back.\r\nThis is not a disciplinary action, but rather, it is a security measure.\r\nThis document was unanimously approved by the immortal council of Minax, Kalus,\r\nIverath, Iblis, and Zeraeka on November 9, 2003.\r\n",

For the purposes of determining\r\nculpability in player-killing cases, lethal actions have been divided into\r\ncombat round actions and non-comat round actions.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nCombat round actions are actions which occur during a face-to-face battle,\r\nin which blows can be exchanged, or in the case of throwing from another\r\nroom, involve a weapon striking a victim.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nNon-combat round actions are actions which do not involve battle, where no\r\nblows can be exchanged.  Most of these actions do not initiate combat.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player character by means\r\nof any non-combat round action.  Some examples of this are forcing a player\r\ncharacter to sleep against their will through the use of a spell or song and\r\nthen allowing them to starve or dehydrate, summoning a player character to\r\nan ambush and not attacking them yourself, teleporting a player character\r\nto an aggressive area, or intentionally pushing aggressive monsters into a\r\nroom with a player.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndirect player-killing IS permitted, however, if it is done by means of a\r\ncombat round action AND the victim is within your level range (8 levels above\r\nor below your own level).  An example of this would be where you poisoned a\r\ncharacter by means of a poisoned weapon or through the use of a spell and\r\nyou then died in combat.

    "HelpText": "\r\nINDIRECT PLAYER-KILLING\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe killing of player characters by indirect means takes place when you or a\r\nmob, pet or charmie that you control causes a player character to die without\r\nmaking a killing blow during a combat round.  For the purposes of determining\r\nculpability in player-killing cases, lethal actions have been divided into\r\ncombat round actions and non-comat round actions.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nCombat round actions are actions which occur during a face-to-face battle,\r\nin which blows can be exchanged, or in the case of throwing from another\r\nroom, involve a weapon striking a victim.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nNon-combat round actions are actions which do not involve battle, where no\r\nblows can be exchanged.  Most of these actions do not initiate combat.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn all cases, it is illegal to indirectly kill a player character by means\r\nof any non-combat round action.  Some examples of this are forcing a player\r\ncharacter to sleep against their will through the use of a spell or song and\r\nthen allowing them to starve or dehydrate, summoning a player character to\r\nan ambush and not attacking them yourself, or teleporting a player character\r\nto an aggressive area.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndirect player-killing IS permitted, however, if it is done by means of a\r\ncombat round action AND the victim is within your level range (8 levels above\r\nor below your own level).  An example of this would be where you poisoned a\r\ncharacter by means of a poisoned weapon or through the use of a spell and\r\nyou then died in combat.  If they later die due to the poison, you are\r\ninnocent of indirect player-killing.  This facet of Indirect Player-Killing\r\nis open to interpretation by the Immortal Staff as to the circumstances\r\nregarding how a character died by indirect means and as such should not be\r\nabused by mortals.

The second goal, is much more insidious.  It is known\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat Auvyron fled to the south, beyond the dwarven ranges to work his\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmagics.  Through theft of documents from the Council of Nine, Jhereg has\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlearned that the rift may still be openable, that artifacts of Auvyron\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmay still exist, and that the secrets of his work might be unconverable.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is possible that by establishing a wide information network, and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthrough carefully planned expeditions, Jhereg may discover Auvyron\u0027s\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlost tower and infiltrate it.  Post-discovery may lead to power, wealth,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge, and the means to eradicate the belief in Auvyron\u0027s philosophy\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom those still pledging allegiance to clan divergent.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

House Jhereg outwardly seeks\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwo goals - first, control crime in Thesden (thus solidfying their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nposition as an organized crime syndicate) and secondly, to over throw\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nFerath Athanmere of Castle Dunluce and seat their in the position of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npower.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        [Misc.]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcerpt from the Journal of Morian e\u0027Drien - The Grey Mouse\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay of Thunder, 23rd the Month of winter\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nChaos rules the land.

Whenever I have a quiet moment I feel a strange beckoning\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the south.  I look there in my dreams and see only darkness.  I\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhear the murmering of the wizards and the philosophers, I read the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhistories and hear the stories from dark corners.  I am discontent.  I\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmust know what is happening.  My people have left their solitude.  I\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfind myself more and more entering these walled areas and exposing\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmyself to the cacophony of the lesser races.  Today I find myself in\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThesden.

    "HelpText": "Necromancer\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMasters of the darkest secrets and most frightening powers, necromancers\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare mages who have chosen the path of evil for their studies.  Necromancers\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnecromancer\u0027s own blood to draw. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nskeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ninnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty\r\u003Cbr\u003E\napparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for\r\u003Cbr\u003E\na lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrozen with fear.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSKILLS\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  1: dagger, staff\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  2: swimming\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  5: wands\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  6: staves\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 10: envenom\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 13: draw: pentagram\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 14: leeching\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 15: butcher\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 16: corpse carving\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 18: fishing\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 20: meditation\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 22: embalm\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 22: embalm\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 23: draw: hexagram\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 24: unsummon\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 25: sense death\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 30: riding\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 33: hellbreath\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 34: draw: death ward\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 40: feign death\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 47: corrupt\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 50: draw: septagram\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 52: feed death\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 60: feast\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCHANTS\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  1: lich eyes\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  5: astral body\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  7: nearsight\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel  8: pox\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 10: skeletal mutation\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 14: exoskeleton\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 15: knowledge of the dead, atrophy\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 17: festering boils\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 18: death vision\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 23: animate dead\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 26: corpse walk\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 27: intoxicate\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 28: calling\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 29: seizure\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 30: darkhounds\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 31: eldritch miasma\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 36: immunity\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 37: bone puppet\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 40: ghost form, bone craft\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 45: wind of death\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 46: drain aura\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 47: vomit\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 49: jinx, decay\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 50: unholy ceremony\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 51: demonic possession\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 55: brain blisters\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 60: clasp\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 62: death palm\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 66: vampirism\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 67: greymantle\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 75: bone hail\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 76: dark sphere\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 80: beacon of the damned\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 81: soul link\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 85: death shroud\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLevel 86: swell\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

It is important that you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfeel you were both given a fair task and judged fairly.  If you feel you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere not, note an immortal about it, and give full details.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-*- Your Role Playing Duties -*-\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKalians who are already remorted, congratulations.  However, you now hold\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe enourmous task of upholding the RP that has been brought to the Kalian\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrole.  I believe that there should be one race that has to be RP down to the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbone, and Kalian just so happens to fit that image.  I encourage all kalians\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto use OOC sparingly.  All kalians should have somewhat of an abrasive edge\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto them.  You should outwardly react to sunlight.

If at any time Myself or another immortal\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfeels any Kalian is slacking in their Role Play, they will be stripped of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe race and turned back into the previous race that they were.  If you need\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore help on RP feel free to ask any immortal.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-*- Being an Adept -*-\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore important for you to take seriously than even the strict role play,  it\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nis up to YOU whether or not another player becomes a kalian.  You must NOT\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlet ooc or personal issues cloud your mind.  The best way to go about\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecruiting another Kalian is to wait for someone to ask you for a Vouch.  Do\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot immediately say yes or no.  Give them a \u0027task\u0027 that will test their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge of the game as well as their role playing skill alike.  After they\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave completed this, use your HONEST judgment on whether or not they deserve\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be remorted.  If you decide that they do, you should pen an RP note to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmortal explaining what you had them do, and why you feel they deserve to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe remorted.  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

Litans in their home environment are nomads,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nliving in dynamic, socially ordered tribes with very little outside contact.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir appearance is humanoid in general form, having four limbs and walking\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nupright - but there the resemblance ends.  Their bodies are covered in dull\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nscales, ranging in color from a light yellow, almost white, to a deep\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nblack-red.  Their faces are featureless, smooth and rounded, with eyes like\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ngleaming coal-black slits.  Their feet have three clawed toes, webbed to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nassist them in navigation of the sandy dunes.  Probably the most interesting\r\u003Cbr\u003E\naspect of creatures is the slimy secretion that covers their scales.  This\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsubstance is highly flammable, and the Litans have developed a specialized\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmethod of utilizing it - two of their teeth are ridged, and can produce\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsparks if clicked together properly, sending the Litan up in flames.  It is\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nan unnerving sight for those unaccustomed to Litans to see one in this\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nstate.  They are, however, immune to heat and fire, and will never be\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndamaged by them, so to a Litan, setting oneself on fire is part and parcel\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof life.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nLitans are a proud race, temperamental and stubborn.  Their cultural\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntradition of tattooing their scales with flamelike and lightning patterns\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nstems from the love of broadcasting their greatness to the world.  They\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nboast and brag of their accomplishments and prowess to anyone near them - a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhabit that has sometimes gotten them into trouble with those more powerful\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan they.  In addition, they tend to be explosive and fiery, like the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsubstance they secrete.  Unfortunately, not being the most intelligent\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeings, they don\u0027t always make good judgements and sometimes end up dead for\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nit.  Although Litans can form bonds of friendship, they generally have no\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfamilial ties or maternal instinct, and the concept of \u0027marriage\u0027 is a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nforeign one - mating is done easy-come, easy-go, generally when tribes meet\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the desert, and they lay eggs deep underneath the sand.

There was Chaos, and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly Chaos.  But nothing ever lasts, such as it was with the power of Chaos.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nSlowly, Time came creeping upon the harmony of disorder, and brought with it\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npurpose and need.  It molded the fabric of the universe as it saw fit,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npatiently filling the void of uncertantiy with destiny.  Eventually, Time\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad won the great war, and Chaos was all but eliminated, until one day... \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a land that would become known as Exodus, Chaos struck back.  It summoned\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfive beings of power to ruin the land and drive the forces of order\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nback into the depths of oblivion from which they came. These five were supreme\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeings, nearly as infinite as Chaos itself. But in order to affect reality\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey were to be made with the slightest taint of order. They took on\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe look of mortals. While their stature was above average, nothing about\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir appearance indicated their omnipotence.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the first day, the sky was filled with a rage of orange and red as the five spread\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfire and death and blood in all directions, each making his own path of destruction as his\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrother made his own in another direction. With a month, the feral world was conquored and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nChaos fired a wave of triumph through the cosmos. Though the land was distrought, the taint\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas alive. In the midst of the burning wastelands and open funeral pyres, one of the five felt\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe bite of insignificance\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

At creation,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   a character chooses a guild to follow.  For instance, a character named\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   Possum chooses to be a warrior at creation.  The character is then\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   considered a stage 1 warrior.  Any stage 1 guildmember has the ability\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   to learn any skills, spells, songs, prayers, or chants of that guild up\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   to level 30.  At level 31, Possum can either choose to continue to be a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   more advanced warrior, or he can choose to become any other class his\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   race permits.  If he chooses to become an assassin, then he will be a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin and will be able to learn skills\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   up to level 30 in both guilds as his own level permits.  If he chooses\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   to remain a warrior at level 31, he will become a stage 2 warrior.  Any\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   stage 2 guildmember will be able to practice all stage 1 skills as well\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   as the more advanced stage 2 skills of that guild.  Upon reaching level\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   61, Possum will be given a third choice.  If he already chose to become\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   a stage 1 warrior and a stage 1 assassin, he might also choose to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   become a stage 1 thief.  He will be very well-rounded, but he will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   possess none of the advanced skills of any of the guilds he is a member\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   of.  If Possum had previously chosen to become a stage 2 warrior and he\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   wishes to stay a warrior, he can become a stage 3 warrior.  As a stage\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   3 warrior, Possum will have access to the most advanced skills of the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   warrior guild, as well as all stage 1 and stage 2 warrior skills.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n   Multiclass can seem a bit overwhelming, since there are over 100 paths\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   a character can take.  If you are daunted by the choices, just remember\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   you can always stay in your chosen guild and become a specialist and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   you will not be any worse off for doing so.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRelated helps: [Help Class] [Help Remort]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n[\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/][\\][/]\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n:============================================================================:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

    "HelpText": "Until now, the rules on naming your alt have been very..  Non-existant. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not going to be a tyrant and say that only strictly mideivel/fantasy\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnames will be allowed.  So this is just to help you understand what is ok\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand what will make me change your name.  Acceptable names would be anything\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou make up that sounds nice, anything you got from a book, a movie, a game,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nor even a TV show.  Like I said, I\u0027m not going to say you HAVE to have a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmideivel name (although it is nice), so if you want, go ahead and name\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyourself Fred.  Names that AREN\u0027T acceptable are vulgar or suggestive. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nExample \u0022Siemen\u0022.  Something like that will NOT pass for \u0022Simon\u0022 and will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nresult in a request to change your name.  Also, stringing together phrases\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nis riduclous.  Example \u0022fillupmytank\u0022 is NOT a name, it doesn\u0027t even\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nremotely resemble one.  Using nouns as names will be accepted under certain\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncercumstances.  For example, \u0022Storm\u0022 is a fine name.  However \u0022Penis\u0022 is\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot.  If you use undying wit and originality to break the rules, they will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe accepted.  An example here is \u0022Mendou\u0022 the name is perfectly innocent and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrelevent until broken down into \u0022Men Do U\u0022 This technically breaks the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrules, but is too funny and well masked to really piss me off.  So in\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nconclusion, please follow these (rather lenient) rules, and if you must\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbreak them, be original.   -Sallana \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

    "HelpText": "\r\nMasters of the darkest secrets and most frightening powers, necromancers\r\nare mages who have chosen the path of evil for their studies.  Necromancers\r\nare evil practitioners of black magic.  They are not good at hand-to-hand\r\ncombat, but are able to perform dark rituals causing their enemies to suffer\r\nand perish in terrible ways.  They explore the magic of the veil between\r\nlife and death, the powers of undeath and demonic forces, allowing them to\r\nanimate the dead, creating undead servants to do their bidding. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nNecromantic spells can be classified into two categories: chants and\r\nrituals.  The first type needs only the necromancers concentration to\r\nperform.  However, the dark rituals of the necromancer always require a\r\nfocusing circle.  Necromancers use three types of circles: pentagrams,\r\nhexagrams, and septagrams for objects, creatures, and area affects\r\nrespectively.  While these symbols increase the power of the necromancer\r\nthey also draw from his life and power, as each requires a portion of the\r\nnecromancer\u0027s own blood to draw. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon choosing the path of the necromancer, every mage must choose which\r\ntype of animation to focus their talents on.  The three common types are\r\nskeletons, zombies, and banshees.  Skeletons, having no flesh, have a\r\nnatural resistance to slashing, but are unable to wear bulky forms of armor.\r\nWhile the origins of the skeleton determine its ability, most tend to come\r\nfrom ancient battles and fight similar to warriors.  Zombies have always\r\nbeen a favorite of necromancers for their natural ability to produce a\r\nplethora of diseases for study.  As is commonly known, zombies lack brains\r\nand also have a taste for them.  The upside to not having brains is that\r\nphysical pain is almost non-existent.  Most zombies while slow have some\r\ninnate instinct which allows them to sneak up behind their victims in\r\ncombat.  The last of the necromantic creations is the banshee.  This misty\r\napparition appears to be a white-robed figure, her face hidden by a dark\r\nhood.  While banshees are unable to wield weapons, they should not be\r\nunderestimated in combat.  The chill touch of a banshee is said to haunt for\r\na lifetime, and their heart-stopping wail is said to leave their enemies\r\nfrozen with fear.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nSKILLS\r\nLevel  1: dagger, staff\r\nLevel  2: swimming\r\nLevel  5: wands\r\nLevel  6: staves\r\nLevel 10: envenom\r\nLevel 13: draw: pentagram\r\nLevel 14: leeching\r\nLevel 15: butcher\r\nLevel 16: corpse carving\r\nLevel 18: fishing\r\nLevel 20: meditation\r\nLevel 23: draw: hexagram\r\nLevel 24: unsummon\r\nLevel 25: sense death, embalm\r\nLevel 30: riding\r\nLevel 33: hellbreath\r\nLevel 34: draw: death ward\r\nLevel 40: feign death\r\nLevel 47: corrupt\r\nLevel 50: draw: septagram\r\nLevel 52: feed death\r\nLevel 60: feast\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nCHANTS\r\nLevel  1: lich eyes\r\nLevel  5: astral body\r\nLevel  7: nearsight\r\nLevel  8: pox\r\nLevel 10: skeletal mutation\r\nLevel 14: exoskeleton\r\nLevel 15: knowledge of the dead, atrophy\r\nLevel 17: festering boils\r\nLevel 18: death vision\r\nLevel 23: animate dead\r\nLevel 26: corpse walk\r\nLevel 27: intoxicate\r\nLevel 28: calling\r\nLevel 29: seizure\r\nLevel 30: darkhounds\r\nLevel 31: eldritch miasma\r\nLevel 36: immunity\r\nLevel 37: bone puppet\r\nLevel 40: ghost form, bone craft\r\nLevel 46: drain aura, wind of death\r\nLevel 47: vomit\r\nLevel 49: jinx, decay\r\nLevel 50: unholy ceremony\r\nLevel 51: demonic possession\r\nLevel 55: brain blisters\r\nLevel 60: clasp\r\nLevel 62: death palm\r\nLevel 66: vampirism\r\nLevel 67: greymantle\r\nLevel 75: bone hail\r\nLevel 76: dark sphere\r\nLevel 80: beacon of the damned\r\nLevel 81: soul link\r\nLevel 85: death shroud\r\nLevel 86: swell\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C \u003E@\u003C\r\n",

    "HelpText": "HISTORY OF THE VRO\u0027ATH CITY OF NRE\u0027YTH\r\n\tOriginally founded as a military outpost by the Vro\u0027ath Marshal\r\nHadukk, Nre\u0027yth is conveniently located in a small, rocky valley between\r\ntwo mountains - Aven Talir to the west and Aven Teluk to the east.  One\r\nof the first projects that Hadukk organized was designed to improve the\r\ndefenses of the outpost.  He ordered walls be built at the north and\r\nsouth ends of the valley, which would effectively seal up Nre\u0027yth since\r\nthe steep mountain slopes to the east and west were natural barriers.\r\nWhile Vro\u0027ath are adept at constructing walls and other military\r\nfortifications, Hadukk still hired some dwarves for help, mainly to mine\r\nbuilding materials from the nearby mountains.\r\n\tAfter the completion of the walls, Hadukk felt secure enough to\r\nallow a civilian population inside Nre\u0027yth, as long as the residents\r\nwould accept martial rule.  Indeed, Nre\u0027yth became a key defensive\r\nstronghold for the Vro\u0027ath.  With adequate supplies and soldiers, Hadukk\r\nfelt that the city could endure multi-year sieges.  Also, Nre\u0027yth lies in\r\nthe way of one of the few routes for traveling to the northern parts of\r\nthe continent.  This allowed the Vro\u0027ath city to dominate a key trade\r\nroute to the north.\r\n\tNaturally, the humans living to the south resented the Vro\u0027ath\r\ncontrol of a key trade route to the north. Some hotheads organized a\r\nforce to seize Nre\u0027yth.  Knowing that a direct assault upon the walls\r\nwould be futile, the humans bribed some dwarves for help.  These dwarves\r\nshowed the humans some passages through the mines in Aven Talir and Aven\r\nTeluk which were unknown to the Vro\u0027ath.  Coming out of these mine\r\npassages, the human attackers were able to surprise the unprepared\r\nVro\u0027ath garrison inside the city.\r\n\tThe humans nearly seized control of Nre\u0027yth, if not for the\r\ndiscipline of the Vro\u0027ath soldiers, which kept them from panicking, and\r\nthe foresight of Marshal Hadukk.  Knowing that Nre\u0027yth was located in a\r\nstrategically important spot, Hadukk had predicted an attack on the city\r\nweeks in advance and had requested reinforcements from other Vro\u0027ath\r\nleaders.  Led by Marshal Bujaghn, the reinforcements came in time to save\r\nthe city for the Vro\u0027ath.  Unfortunately, Bujaghn was not in time to save\r\nhis colleague Hadukk, who was killed in a ferocious, almost suicidal,\r\ncharge by a band of human knights.  The arrival of Bujaghn\u0027s forces\r\nturned the tide, and almost all the human attackers were either killed or\r\ncaptured.  The few dwarven accomplices of the humans were also caught.\r\n\tAs punishment, Bujaghn put the human and dwarven captives to work\r\nin the mines. One of their first tasks was to collapse those passages\r\nwhich would undermine the defense of the city.  Furthermore, Bujaghn\r\ndecided that he would enslave these humans for the rest of their lives.\r\nAt this point, the Vro\u0027ath religious leaders intervened. Such an act of\r\ncruelty would only reinforce the Vro\u0027ath \u0022brute\u0022 image that other races\r\nsaw.  The Vro\u0027ath priests worked diligently to banish such an image from\r\neveryone\u0027s eyes. However, Bujaghn would not budge in his position; he\r\nfelt that slave was more than those human captives deserved. A compromise\r\nwas reached: Bujaghn would be allowed keep his slaves, but they were to\r\nbe well treated and released after serving faithfully for five years.\r\nHowever, Bujaghn negotiated a couple important concessions from the\r\nVro\u0027ath church leaders. First, owners of slaves were allowed to sell\r\nslaves as property.  Second, all future prisoners captured in military\r\nencounters with the Vro\u0027ath would also be subjected to slavery.  Thus,\r\nBujaghn can be considered the founder of the Vro\u0027ath slave trade.  He\r\nalso organized the first slave raiding parties.  These were small bands\r\nof highly trained Vro\u0027ath soldiers who attacked frontier human\r\nsettlements or groups of unsuspecting travelers, never with the intent to\r\nkill, but only to capture humans alive.  The Vro\u0027ath religious leaders\r\ngrumbled a bit about this, but they grudgingly ignored these acts as long\r\nas the slaves were allowed to free after five years.\r\n\tAt present, Nre\u0027yth is still primarily a trading city, with slaves\r\nbeing the major commodity.  Slave raiders still exist, but they now\r\ninclude other races as targets for slaves.  Rule in the city is a tenuous\r\nbalance of power between the leaders of the church and the military.  The\r\ncurrent leaders of Nre\u0027yth are Marshal Torqenuk and High Priest il\u0027Reshaz.\r\n",

    "HelpText": " Centuries ago in Ebon Downs assassins trained for many hours,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nall day and all night, till the crickets were chirping and making music into\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe night sky.   After years of training the best of the assassins\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbanded together with particularly gifted thieves and made their way\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntowards the city of Thesden.   Along the way they stumbled upon a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyoung woman with long, pitch-black hair and surrounded in a cloud of dark\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmist.  She smiled at them, her ancient eyes telling the stories of life\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand death.   The young necromancer joined their ranks and continued\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith them to their destination.    Once in Thesden they spread out\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto find more men and women who practiced the same dark arts and trickery. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n They established clan Parlous: where Assassins, Thieves,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand Necromancers are welcome to practice their skills and dark magic\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithout being persecuted, and Kalians of all classes are welcome into\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir ranks.   The leader of the clan held rank for about a year before\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmysteriously disappearing into the shadows beyond the borders of Lunar\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlains.   The clan quickly fell into disrepair everyone moving in\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifferent directions, killing other clan members at randomly, attempting to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake leadership but constantly failing.   When the overwhelming scream\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof death erupted from Dharkhum the entire clan stopped to stare in awe. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nA tall, strong man with glistening muscles rippling in strength walks into\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntown, carrying the body of Dharkhum.   He throws the slain\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndragon down at the doorway of the Parlous clan door, and ignoring the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nastonished looks of the clan members he walks through without a backward glance. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrank instantly.   He brought Parlous to a new height of prestige, and he\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nexpanded the clan by seeking out skilled assassins, thieves,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnecromancers, and Kalians who showed promise early on.  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlthough clan Parlous mostly preferred to kill the clean-cut clan\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmembers, such as Alliant and Brotherhood, they were not opposed to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlashing out to people who held no affiliation, and would do so for no\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nreason, if not to prove their skills or to simply enjoy the screams of a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndying man.   Today the same young man runs Parlous, and his clan\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontinues to grow.  He still holds onto the original policies of the clan:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou must be an Assassin, Thief, Necromancer, or Kalian of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nany class.   You must be willing to kill without structured reason, and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalways be willing to fight and die for the cause.   \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

    "HelpText": "There are a couple of different kinds of Immortals on Exodus.  One kind is\r\na \u0027coder\u0027 Immortal who has been created in order to test new code.  The other\r\nkind is an Admin immortal.  Admins can be regular immortals whose sole job is\r\nto help newbies and answer questions or they may have more specialized roles\r\nsuch as being in charge of Clans, Questing or Law.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhether you are a coder Immortal or one of the Admin persuasion, you are\r\nexpected to follow the guidelines found in \u0027help immortal laws\u0027 to the\r\nletter.  Additionally, there are a few pointers that need to be followed when\r\ndealing with the mortal population.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  When speaking to mortals, ALWAYS try your very best to be \u0027visible\u0027 to\r\n  the mortals you are speaking to.  There may be instances when this isn\u0027t\r\n  possible for whatever reason, but those instances should be very rare.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  As stated in \u0027help immortal laws\u0027 do NOT kill mortals under any\r\n  circumstances.  There may be a very rare instance where it is necessary to\r\n  slay a mortal for misbehavior, but again, this should be extremely rare.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  It is very fun to play with mortals by switching into mobs.  Be very\r\n  prepared to wind up killing mortals if you play with them by switching into\r\n  naturally aggressive mobs.  Make no mistake -- if you are switched into an\r\n  aggressive mob, you WILL wind up killing a mortal at some point as you will\r\n  not have full control over that mob\u0027s actions.  (Read above point regarding\r\n  killing mortals).   Mortals do not like being killed by Immortals under any\r\n  reason, whether they are being played with or not, with the exception of\r\n  when quests are run.  So, if you want to have fun with them, the best way\r\n  to do this is to run a quest.  By doing this you cover yourself should a\r\n  mortal die and you make points with mortals because they like quests.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  Roleplay is to be encouraged on Exodus, whether you are an Immortal\r\n  roleplaying or a mortal.  However, it has been found that Immortals\r\n  roleplaying a relationship with mortals tends to create a lot of confusion\r\n  on the MUD from a player standpoint and can even affect the Immortal\r\n  Staff as a whole in some rare instances.  For this reason please do not\r\n  roleplay relationships with mortals (which includes net sex).  You are more\r\n  than welcome to create a mortal character for this type of roleplay.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  Coder Immortals, as stated above, are in existence to test code on the\r\n  live port.  As this is so, coder immortal interaction with the mortal\r\n  population on Exodus should be kept down to a bare minimum.  It is the job\r\n  of Admin Immortals to deal with the Exodus population in matters of helping\r\n  newbies, answering questions, running quests, making sure rules are\r\n  followed, and other related issues.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  *  If a mortal writes to you specifically, please respond to them in a\r\n  prompt fashion if their note requires a response.  Not responding to\r\n  notes written specifically to you is a huge irritant to the mortal\r\n  population as a whole.  It\u0027s simply a matter of courtesy.  If you wrote to\r\n  them about a question or an important matter, you would expect a prompt\r\n  reply (if they were logged on).  So please, try to respond to your notes as\r\n  soon as conveniently possible.\r\n",

The pirates were fierce and many a life was lost, until we discovered the horrible properties of the Quicksand.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nPirates who once thought that perhaps, the sand and water were their home now feared to be summoned through arcane portals and gates to be slaughtered, not being able to move, nor defend themselves.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe quicksand quickly became known as the GreenWood killing grounds, it was discussed with horor with GreenWood\u0027s enemies, as a place where the Tricky-multi-kill and the Want a summon back to your corpse kill were invented.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe days passed, and the memory of the quicksand was now no longer discussed, in fact no longer used, the enemies and even the allies of GreenWood taunted us.

    "HelpText": "Reavers are an evil cult of religious zealots who serve their Dark Lord\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nby destroying all which is good and pure in the world.  Just as the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nPaladin serves the forces of good in the world, the Reaver is the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncounterpart, black-hearted swordsman.  The manifestation of the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nReavers faith is the blade they wield the symbol of their cult.  The\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nReavers are based entirely around the blade, which is the only weapon\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey are allowed to wield.  This blade has a mind of its own and is as\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch a part of the reaver as any other limb.  As the Reaver grows in\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npower, so does his blade.  By capturing the souls of the slain, a reaver\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmay feed the dark will of his blade and gain power through it.  Soul\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nenergies of the slain are sacrificed into the blade like a type of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncurrency.  It is said that the developed blade in the hands of a skilled\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nreaver is a potentially unlimited force.  Reavers may also store spells\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithin the sword to be summoned forth at a time of their choosing.  A\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nReaver who strays even slightly onto the realm of goodness is rebuked\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nby his weapon, which abandons him until he returns to the path of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndarkness.  Note: Reavers have special commands involving their swords. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Csword options\u003E shows what commands you may perform involving the sword. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome sword commands may be performed anywhere and some must be performed\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the dark sanctuary of the Reaver guild hall.  All sword upgrades must be\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nperformed in the dark sanctuary.  The same is true for all blade and burst\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nspells, which can only be cast upon the sword at the altar of annihilation.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce spells are stored in the sword, they may be invoked anywhere.  The\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nduration of blade spells and the effect of burst spells is directly related\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the alignment of the Reaver--the more evil the Reaver, the greater the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\neffect.  When a Reaver dies, he must return to the dark altar in order to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvoke his sword again, although any spells and upgrades will stay in the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsword.  Soul Energies (SE) are reaped from mobs based on their level and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalignment.  Angelic mobs and more powerful mobs will give more SE.  Reaver\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nblades are open-ended, meaning there is no cap on the power one can imbue\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis blade with, although the cost of upgrading the blade increases\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndramatically as the blade becomes more powerful.  Combat upgrades fall into\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfour categories: Power, Hatred, Fury, and Strength.  Raising the Power of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyour blade will moderately increase the damage your blade can inflict,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nalthough you may not notice right away.  Hatred is a more dramatic and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nobvious upgrade, but it is also more expensive.  Fury refers to the vigor\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith which the Reaver attacks the target.  Improving Fury will give you a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbetter chance of hitting your opponent.  Blade Strength is another aspect\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich determines the damage done by your Reaver blade.  Try upgrading each\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof them in turn to keep your sword balanced.  Before you can store a blade\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nspell in your blade, you must upgrade the sword to contain a slot for it. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou may buy more than one slot of each type of blade spell, although the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncost goes up each time.  Once you have purchased a slot for a blade spell,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou may go to the altar of annihilation and chant the appropriate blade or\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nburst spell.  If successful, it will be stored in the blade and will appear\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nin \u003Csword options\u003E.  Once the spell is stored, you may invoke it at any\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime.

By following\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nXjndor Brakaii, the true god of the Sidhe people, we shall once again rule\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe realms, and all shall know our power.  We seek not a physical\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nrevolution for their is no ruling class or clan to revolt against, but a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nmental revolution in which everyone will come to fear the true power of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Sidhe.

The Ram Brakka is the lowest group, they are mainly the helpers of the \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nother two groups.  They provide services for the other members and help keep the clan\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nin balance.  They usually stay out of battle, but nonetheless can kill the enemy when\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nneeded.  The Nal Xjin is the second to highest group.  Their job is to kill, but they\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare still learning and do not yet have the experience and sheer power to be in the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nXjo Kyn.  The Xjo Kyn is the highest group. They are the super-elite Sidhe.  Their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\njob is to drive sheer terror into the enemy, for few have ever survived a battle with\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nan Xjo Kyn, and even fewer have seen one dead.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTolerations\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   In order to complete the revolution, we must tolerate some other inhabitants of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nExodus.

Don\u0027t assume GT\u0027s are OOC unless you\u0027ve asked\r\n          first. Says, Gossip, Clan Talk, and emotes should ALWAYS be IC.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n* It\u0027s not okay to use terms like Stats, HP/MANA, Leveling, AC, etcetera.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   Examples:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    X What stats are best for a mage?\r\n    * As a magic user, will I need to be overly charismatic?\r\n                \r\n    X How much mana do you have?\r\n    * Do you have a large pool of magical reserves?\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    X Want to go leveling?

This is probably the worst thing you can do.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Examples:\r\n     X emote slaps you and you cower in a corner.\r\n     * emote slaps you and fixes you with an icy stare.\r\n               \r\n       Never take the control of someone\u0027s character away from them.\r\n       A level 90 Kalian Reaver for instance, likely wouldn\u0027t \u0027cower\u0027\r\n       over anything. That\u0027s not for you to say. You do the action,\r\n       NEVER, EVER, EVER the reaction.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n* The gossip channel should be a tool for an RP character, not a go-to.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    Examples:\r\n   X Oh, hi someone. It\u0027s nice to see you again.\r\n    (Take it to tells or find them in game.)\r\n    * Is anyone interested in hunting with me?\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   There are exceptions to this rule. I\u0027ve seen some pretty awesome RP\r\n   go down on the gossip channel, and I\u0027ve seen some RP that just doesn\u0027t\r\n   belong there. In time, you will learn the difference. At the beginning,\r\n   you should just stay away from it unless you NEED to ask a public\r\n   question.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Grammar and spelling is important. Yes, I\u0027m going to go here. In the past,\r\n  I\u0027ve said that having poor spelling/grammar is the MUD analogue of having\r\n  a severe speech impediment in real life. I was immediately countered with\r\n  \u0027Who are you to tell me my character doesn\u0027t!\u0027 - Okay, fair argument. Your\r\n  character may have a speech impediment, fine. But think of how such a thing\r\n  might be presented in a fantasy novel. Could you read a book if every other\r\n  word was misspelled? Just keep that in mind.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll in all, RP is about taking on a completely different mindset. What that\r\nis, is completely up to you and how you want your character to act. The best\r\nway to get into it initially is to simply pretend you\u0027re in medieval times.\r\nBe a child for a while, use your imagination. Anything that doesn\u0027t make\r\nsense to someone who lived in a castle hundreds of years ago shouldn\u0027t make\r\nsense to your character - grant me some lenience here with magic.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n:============================================================================:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

    "HelpText": "\r\n * Making shops (including pet shops and stables)\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   \u002B Making a basic shop\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n     Though shops are thought of as the rooms they are in, all of\r\n     the true shop information is linked to the mobile that acts\r\n     as shop keeper, not the room the keeper appears in.  Thus, in order\r\n     to set up a room as a shop, you must create a mobile that will\r\n     act as shopkeeper.  In the mobile editor (medit), there is a command\r\n     \u0027shop\u0027 that lets you set values that will determine how the shop\r\n     will function.  The shop command has four arguments: hours,\r\n     profit, type and delete.  Using the \u0027hours\u0027 argument with shop\r\n     allows you to set what type the shop opens and closes.  \r\n     The syntax is: \u0027shop hours [open-hour] [close-hour]\u0027.  The times here\r\n     are in 24-hour format.  So for a shop to open at 9 am and close at\r\n     5 pm, the command would be \u0027shop hours 9 17\u0027.  For a shop that is \r\n     always open, use \u0027shop hours 0 23\u0027.  Using the \u0027profit\u0027 argument with\r\n     shop allows you to set the markups on object cost for buying and \r\n     selling.  To buy and sell products at-cost, these markup values\r\n     should be set to 100 (100% of cost).  The syntax is:\r\n     \u0027shop profit [buy-profit] [sell-profit]\u0027.  If you wanted to create\r\n     a shopkeeper that would sell object at 120% of cost (20% more than\r\n     their actual cost value) and buy objects at-cost, the command used\r\n     would be \u0027shop profit 120 100\u0027.  Using the \u0027type\u0027 argument with\r\n     the shop command allows you to set which types of objects this\r\n     shop keeper will buy and sell.  Up to 5 (0-4) different object types\r\n     can be traded.   The syntax is: shop type [0-4] [item type].\r\n     So, for a shop that would be trading weapons and armor, two commands\r\n     would be used:  \u0027shop type 0 weapon\u0027, \u0027shop type 1 armor\u0027.  Valid\r\n     object types for this command are: Light, Scroll, Wand, Staff, Weapon\r\n     Treasure, Armor, Potion, Clothing, Furniture, Container, Drink Container,\r\n     Boat, Pill, Map, Portal, Warpstone, Gem, Jewelry.\r\n     The \u0027delete\u0027 argument for shop allows you delete item types you\r\n     have previously set.  For example, to convert the previous shop to\r\n     armor-only, the command would be \u0027shop delete 0\u0027.  \r\n     \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \u002B Stocking the shop\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n     In order to give the shop items, you must reset these item into\r\n     the shop keeper\u0027s inventory.  (Please see the RESETS section of this \r\n     document for more information.)\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \u002B Creating a pet shop or a stable\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n     Pet shops and stables are special shop types.  In order to create\r\n     these kinds of shops you must have two consecutive vnum-ed rooms free.\r\n     If you wanted to use room vnum \u00275000\u0027 as a pet shop or a stable, then\r\n     room vnum \u00275001\u0027 would have to be created.  \u00275001\u0027 acts as a \r\n     \u0027back room\u0027 for the pet shop or stable, and it\u0027s where all the animals\r\n     are held.  Back rooms for pet shops or stables should _not_ \r\n     be linked to other rooms under normal circumstances.\r\n     The store-front room (5000, here) should be flagged as either\r\n      \u0027pet_shop\u0027 or \u0027stable\u0027 using the \u0027room\u0027 command from the room editor.\r\n     Example: edit room 5000\r\n              room pet_shop\r\n     Once this room is created, a shopkeeper mob should be created as normal\r\n     (see above).  This shopkeeper should then be set to reset into the\r\n     store-front room (5000 in this example).  All the pets or mounts\r\n     this shopkeeper can sell should then be set up with mob resets in \r\n     the back-room (5001, here.).\r\n",

Most  of the time, this energy is  given off so  efficiently that\r\u003Cbr\u003E\neven  people right beside the  freshly corpsed creature will not even notice\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat has just happened.                                                     \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOccasionally, however, the  magical  energy  is trapped as it tries to leave\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe body, and it instantly crystalizes  into the form of a small gem.  These\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsoul gems are weightless: it would  be entirely possible to carry thousands,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nif one wished, with no more burden or encumberance than a thousand grains of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsand.                                                                      \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nEach soul gem is unique, reflecting the essence of the being which  died to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ngive it shape.  Because  of the  rarity of  these gems, they are  emanantly\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncollectible and people in lands all over Exodus have been known to trade them\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nback and forth until they get as  perfect and  complete a  set as possible.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nAvariel in particular is said to be a fanatic collector,  and it\u0027s rumoured\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat she  will trade  interesting objects for unique sets of ten or more\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ngems.  Unlike  most quests,  this one  is completely  player-run, and takes\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nplace at the player\u0027s leisure.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nAvariel will also hand out free bags to keep soul gems in, if asked nicely.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n============================================================================\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

A new region of the island has been\r\ndrained and paved and new construction has begun.

He tried to wear the crown, \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut was zapped by its extreme evil, and left for dead. He awoke in a chamber of corpses and blood \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand filth, weary but still able to recal what had happened. On his hand was a burned engraved  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nimage of the crown. He was shortly transported away, and back into Thesden. Later that night \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe heard a voice in dream. The voice told him that he was given a gift. That he would be the one \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto find the true evil. The voice told him to find others, and to kill all those who opposed him.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus began his quest to find the one who can bring pure evil among the world.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

These dreams haunted\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe few Vro\u0027ath who still had honor.... who were still true warriors of the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nholy Ne\u0027Shajh.  The great Ne\u0027Shajh himself flitted through these \r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndreams, telling the Vro\u0027ath where they had gone wrong... what they should do \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto fix this.  He showed them how they had been blinded by money and personal\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npower.  They no longer worked for the greater good of the Vro\u0027ath people! \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthese dreams came most strongly to one Vro\u0027ath, the Vro\u0027ath know as Arith.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nNe\u0027Shajh made Arith remember that day, the day that Arith\u0027s family had\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen burned alive by an unforseen attack by elves.

Ne\u0027Shajh told Arith \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat his life had not been spared so that he could become a slaver.  Arith was\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto work for the greater good of the Vro\u0027ath people!

Arith then knelt down at the altar and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe fire within him burst out, consuming his mortal form.  Then Arith\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nemerged from the fire, recreated.

A tribe of elves made their home in this forest, and\r\ndefended it against any attackers, particularly the degenerate orcs\r\nwho feared the elves even more than they feared their own kings.\r\nSea travelers occasionally stopped in Colwyn Bay, as it was good\r\nprotection from rough seas, and safe lands (though it is doubtful the\r\ntravelers and merchants knew it) because of the elves.

In those days, the town was organized by a\r\nsmall council and it grew rapidly. In those days, a pantheon of gods\r\nwere worshipped, Urderan the god of deep waters and Ayvril god of\r\nstorm and plenty being the most prominent.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n-As the years past, the town grew quickly, becoming an important\r\ncenter of trade, initially for basic goods like food, but increasingly\r\nfor textiles due to the mines beginning to be excavated not far from\r\ntown. Things were going well until a series of bad events led to a\r\ndark time. For the first time, the mysterious plague hit, killing many\r\nof the people. Strangely, at the same time as the plague, a massive\r\narmy of orcs came from the north, decimating elves and humans\r\nalike. The army was finally defeated, but only at great cost.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n-For protection, and as a result of the new ties between elf and\r\nhuman, a treaty was forged. The people of Thesden agreed to leave a\r\nlarge portion of the forests west of Thesden unharvested, to help\r\ndefend the forests against attackers, and to assist the elves with food\r\nand any other aid they needed. The elves, in turn, helped with the\r\nmagics necessary to build Castle Dunluce. At the same time, the\r\ntown council agreed to hand over power to the man they had\r\nappointed general during the war, Ythran Athanmere, made first\r\nking of Castle Dunluce. As a way of sealing the ties, the second born\r\nof the Athanmere line was always wed to one of the elves, creating\r\nan entire noble class of half-elven. It is said that those who call\r\nthemselves Rangers now may be descendants of these half-elven\r\nknights. Also, one of the elvish elders always acted as advisor to the\r\nking. And so it was, for many years.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Years later, as tensions built between elf and human, the city grew,\r\nbeliefs changed. Many people began to follow the Church with the\r\nits one God of fire and hope and its cult of martyrs. The tensions\r\nbroke and erupted into a civil war. As one tale goes, the elves failed\r\nto warn the town of an incoming attack, allowing an army of Orcs to\r\nburn much of the outlying farms and reach the gates of the castle\r\nitself before they were stopped. Many believe the elves feared the\r\nhumans would begin to log the forest in their need for trees. Lord\r\nDevon Athanmere, newly appointed king, it is said, banished the\r\nelves from the court, ordering the beheading of the elvish advisor\r\nEyth\u0027reane on grounds of being a traitor. Another, very different\r\ntale, seldom told by anyone except the most fanciful bards of the\r\ncollege, says that young Devon Athanmere, first-born, was deeply in\r\nlove with the elvish princess Llynilon. When it was announced that\r\nhis younger brother would marry the princess, as tradition held,\r\nDevon slew his brother in a fit of rage. Llynilon, distraut at having\r\nlost her future husband whom she did indeed love, took her life by\r\njumping off the parapets of Castle Dunluce. The elves, shocked by\r\nthe injustice, and blaming Devon, withdrew and lets the orcs\r\napproach town. Whichever story is true, Devon had his advisor\r\nEyth\u0027reane beheaded, and ordered all elves banished or killed. The\r\nhalf-elves, too, were driven out, called degenerates. Though it is\r\nrumored that many of them did little more than move into the forest\r\noutside town to become rangers. Devon did not last long on the\r\nthrone, he mysteriously died after dinner one evening. One of the\r\nking\u0027s knights, the strong Ihnian Toryn took the throne. He claimed\r\nto be a cousin to Devon, took the Athanmere name and enshrined\r\nthe memory of Devon naming the central town square after him.\r\nThe remaining close relatives of the Athanmeres also mysteriously\r\ndisappeared after voicing opposition.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The descendants of Ihnian Toryn Athanmere have ruled since that\r\nday.

    "HelpText": "Trophy fishing has long been a favorite pastime of the upper crust of Exodus.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe art of tracking, luring, and catching large fish possesses a draw that has\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nenthralled people of all status from royalty to the peasant adventurer.  It\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nis said that the ocean holds fish of all sizes, including several legendary\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfish, which nobody really knows to exist.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn order to properly fish for a trophy fish, one must first get a fishing pole.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe appropriate fishing pole can be purchased from the Emporium in Freeport.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext you need some bait.  Every fisherman knows the best bait is a can of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nworms, which can be found in Ebon Downs at the Fish and Tackle shop.  Be\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsure to buy PLENTY of bait, because you probably won\u0027t catch a legendary fish\r\u003Cbr\u003E\non your first try.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter procuring the necessary equipment, it\u0027s time to head to sea.  Those who\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare excellent swimmers can strike out on their own, while others may choose\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nto charter a boat.  Either way, sail out into the salty blue until you find a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nspot you like.  There are several hot spots for fishing in the ocean and you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan never be completely sure where one will be, so if you fish for a while and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly come up with little fish, it may be time to move on to another spot.  The\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncloser you get to a hot spot, the larger the variance in the size of the fish.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, when you have found a spot, the next step is to [hold pole] and then\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n[bait line] using your bait.  Finally, [cast line] to start fishing.  Wait a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlittle while to see if you get a hit.  Typically, a chance for a nibble comes\r\u003Cbr\u003E\naround a couple times a minute.  You can [reel line] to attempt to entice the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfish around you to take a bite.  Eventually, you will feel a tug on your line.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen this happens, it\u0027s decision time.  You can [reel line] to try to hook the\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfish.  If it\u0027s a smaller fish, reeling right away will have a better chance of\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhooking it.  For larger fish, you may want to wait until you get a stronger\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npull on the line or else you might scare it away.  With a little skill and\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nluck, you will hook the fish.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve hooked the fish, you need to fight it to bring it in.  You will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee the line zig through the water.  When the line tension shows up as ***\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou should [reel line] and wait a few seconds.  When line tension is *** it\u0027s\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime to [reel slacken] so that you don\u0027t snap the line.  Larger fish will\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfight more than smaller fish, so get ready for a challenge.  If all goes\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell, you will eventually reel in the fish and have your prize.  If you\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nlose your bait or just feel like starting over, you can [reel all] to\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nstart over.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo why would anyone want to put up with all this nonsense just to catch a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nsilly fish?  Money and prestige.  Trophy fish can sell for incredible amounts\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nof money.  Even the smallest fish sell for a few gold.  Larger fish over 200\r\u003Cbr\u003E\npounds can sell in the thousands of gold.  It is said that legendary fish\r\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan sell for as much as 15,000 gold, although they are rarely caught unless\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe fisherman has the good fortune to zero in on a hotspot.  Some legendary\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfish even have their own names and reputations from those who have seen them\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nand lived to escape.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| tire Vro\u0027ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| together in the name of the great god Ne\u0027Shajh, and united under the    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro\u0027ath |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the name of Ne\u0027Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne\u0027Shajh  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro\u0027ath race as the dominant race    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro\u0027ath race is superior to all others, | \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d that only the Vro\u0027ath deserve to rule.  The only race tolerable to  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the Varruk is the Dwarves, due to their greed and ability to build and  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reate great temples and monuments.  All other races are treated with   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| sgust and distrust, and are assossiated with as little possible.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  The clan is led by a council, headed by the Leader and with a          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| representative of each faction having a seat upon it.  Since the        |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060actions within the clan often have different goals and ideas on how    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to conqour the realm, there are often quarrels and turmoil within the   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| an between members of the different factions; and due to the fact     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| that the leadership positions are positions held by strength alone,     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060ssassination attemps and coups are not uncommon within the upper ranks |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060f the clan.                                                            |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                               Requirments                               |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| The following requirements must be met in order to join Varruk          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Race:Vro\u0027ath.

But in all this time, the clan of       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Varruk has held strong and has endured countless wars and struggles     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| for power.  Though it started out as an organized group of slavers      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| oking for nothing more then wealth, the clan had slowly come to       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| symbolize something more, it had come to represent the strength of the  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| tire Vro\u0027ath nation.  As the great leaders of Varruk and Teluk came   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to this realization, they set aside their differences and rallyed       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| together in the name of the great god Ne\u0027Shajh, and united under the    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ag of the Varruk.                                                     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  With the union of the two main factions, most of the remaining Vro\u0027ath |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| ined the ranks of Varruk as well.  These mergers changed Varruk       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reatly, changing it from a clan of slavers, into a mix of factions     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d sects, which would all be governed by a complicated heiarchy of     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| chieftans and sub-chieftans all ruling over their own followers within  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the clan.  Though the factions within Varruk still have a good deal of  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| infighhting and animosity beween each other, they would all quickly set |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060side their differences in the face of a common enemy, and unite in     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the name of Ne\u0027Shajh whenever another was threatened by outsiders.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                Role-Play                                |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  Though the factions within Varruk may have different beliefs and ideas,|\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| they are all united in their devotion to the all-powerful god Ne\u0027Shajh  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d in their goal to reinstate the Vro\u0027ath race as the dominant race    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| within the realm.  This desire to rule all of the realm stems from      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the deep seated belief that the Vro\u0027ath race is superior to all others, | \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| d that only the Vro\u0027ath deserve to rule.  The only race tolerable to  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| the Varruk is the Dwarves, due to their greed and ability to build and  |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060reate great temples and monuments.  All other races are treated with   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| sgust and distrust, and are assossiated with as little possible.      |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|  The clan is led by a council, headed by the Leader and with a          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| representative of each faction having a seat upon it.  Since the        |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060actions within the clan often have different goals and ideas on how    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| to conqour the realm, there are often quarrels and turmoil within the   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| an between members of the different factions; and due to the fact     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| that the leadership positions are positions held by strength alone,     |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060ssassination attemps and coups are not uncommon within the upper ranks |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| \u0060f the clan.                                                            |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                               Requirments                               |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| The following requirements must be met in order to join Varruk          |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Race: Vro\u0027ath, Dwarf                                                    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Alignment: Evil                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Class: Warrior, Cleric, Mage                                            |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Level: Preferably 20\u002B but will be accepted at 10 or higher              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n|                                                                         |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| After being accepted into the clan, you must choose one of the factions |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| or if you are ambitious you can get other Varruk together and create    |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| your own faction within the clan.                                       |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\u002B\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n",

Generally 4 is a neutral mood,\r\n\tlower than 4 is progressively more unhappy and greater than 4\r\n \tis progressively more happy.  Valid values for this entry include\r\n\tthings like \u00273\u0027 (if mood is 3, this trigger is valid),\r\n\t\u0027\u003E4\u0027 (if mood is greater than (but NOT equal to) 4, than this \r\n\ttrigger is valud), \u0027\u003C7\u0027 (if mood is less than 7, this trigger\r\n\tis valid).  The next value you must enter represents how the\r\n\tmob\u0027s mood should be offset if this trigger is hit.  This\r\n\tvalue can be a number, such as \u00276\u0027 (if this trigger is hit,\r\n\tautomatically set mob\u0027s mood to 6), an increment, such\r\n\tas \u0027\u002B2\u0027 (if this trigger is hit, add 2 to the mob\u0027s mood),\r\n\ta decrement, such as \u0027-1\u0027 (if this trigger is hit, subtract 1\r\n\tfrom the mob\u0027s mood), or \u0027-\u0027 which signifies that this trigger\r\n\tshould not affect the mob\u0027s mood at all.\r\n\tThe last piece of information you need to supply is what the \r\n\tmob should say and do when this trigger is hit.  If the mob\r\n\tsees this text in a say, it will respond in a say; if it sees\r\n\tit in a tell, it will respond in a tell.  Multiple lines\r\n\tmay be seperated by the semicolon (;).  A special keyword,\r\n\tCMD, may be used to make the mob enter regular mud commands.\r\n\tFor example, entering \u0022Hi, I am a mob!\u0022 would cause the mob\r\n\tto say \u0022Hi, I am a mob!\u0022 when this trigger is met.\r\n\tEntering \u0022I am really mad; CMD frown\u0022 would cause the\r\n\tmob to say \u0022I am really mad\u0022 and then execute the command\r\n\t\u0027frown\u0027.\r\n\tThere are a number of special variables (that represent information\r\n\tabout the character that tripped the trigger) that may appear in this\r\n\ttext, they are:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\t\t$name   - Replace with character\u0027s name\r\n\t\t$area   - Replace with area name of area character is in\r\n\t\t$room   - Replace with room name of room character is in\r\n\t\t$level  - Replace with character\u0027s current level\r\n\t\t$race   - Replace with character\u0027s race name\r\n\t\t$clan   - Replace with character\u0027s clan name\r\n\t\t$class  - Replace with character\u0027s class name\r\n\t\t$time   - Replace with current (game) time\r\n\t\r\n\tFor example, if you created a trigger text of \u0022what\u0026time\u0026is\u0026it\u0022,\r\n\tyou may want to make a respond test of \u0022Thanks for asking $name,\r\n\tit is $time!\u0022  Assuming character \u0022Bob\u0022 said \u0022what time is it?\u0022\r\n\tto the mobile using this vocabulary entry at 7 pm (game time), \r\n\tthe mobile would respond \u0022Thanks for asking, Bob, it is 7 o\u0027clock pm!\u0022\r\n\tThese variables can be used with the CMD commands too, so\r\n\ta valid response text could be \u0022I have had enough of you.; CMD kill\r\n\t$name\u0022.  \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        SPECIAL TRIGGER TEXT:  When you are adding vocabulary\r\n        triggers, rather than input a list of words at the first prompt\r\n\tyou may also enter one of two special triiger texts.  The first\r\n\tis \u0027DEFAULT\u0027 (note: Unlike most of the vocabulary trigger\r\n\twords, DEFAULT is case-sensitive and must always be entered\r\n\tin uppercase).  You may have as many \u0027DEFAULT\u0027 lines in a \r\n\tvocabulary file as you want, and these lines are used when someone\r\n\ttalks to a mob but the mob finds no regular matches within\r\n\tit\u0027s vocabulary list.  If you have more than one DEFAULT, one\r\n        will be chosen randomly when a character speaks to a mobile using\r\n        words it doesn\u0027t understand.  You may want to bait the character into\r\n\ta conversational topic of your choosing by using DEFAULT entries\r\n\tthat greet the character, and leak some information that the\r\n\tmob is prepared to talk about.  The second special trigger text\r\n\tis \u0027INCLUDE\u0027 (also uppercase-only).  INCLUDE allows you to\r\n\t\u0027stack\u0027 vocabulary files on top of each other.  When you enter\r\n\tthe INCLUDE trigger text, you will only be asked for the filename\r\n\tof a vocabulary file to stack into the one you are editing.  \r\n\tNested includes (INCLUDE a file that also INCLUDES another file)\r\n\tare allowed, up to 5 levels.  After 5 levels, nesting is halted\r\n\tto avoid any possible infinite recursion loops (one file INCLUDEs\r\n\tanother, which INCLUDEs the first, etc.)  When the vocabulary\r\n        files are stacked, the mob will go through the word lists in \r\n\teach trying to find matches.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n    2. Listing currently defined vocabulary entries\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\tTo list the vocabulary entries you have already added to this\r\n\tparticular vocabulary file, type \u0022list\u0022, and a list (with line\r\n\tnumbers) will be given.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n    3.  Deleting vocabulary entries\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n        To delete a specific vocabulary entry, type \u0022delete \u003Cline#\u003E\u0022\r\n\tto delete the \u0022\u003Cline#\u003E\u0022 line.  Line numbers may be determined\r\n\tby using the list command and using the number that appears\r\n\ton the far left.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nC.  Deleting  existing vocabulary files.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\tTo delete a vocabulary file that you own, simply type\r\n\t\u0022delete \u003Cfilename\u003E\u0022 from the main vocabulary file editing menu.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nD.

Werecreatures  have the ability  to shift into their beastial\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nform, and back, without any harm  done to themselves or others*. In fact, \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen a  werecreature is shifted,  they tend  to be much stronger  than their\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nnormal selves.  Each race becomes  a different  were creature.  Remort races \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nare  excluded,  considered to be  much more powerful  than the  regular weak \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nraces,  they are immune to the were gene unless it was possessed before they \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nremorted.  During a normal race\u0027s leveling experience, each level promotes a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nfraction of a  chance that the race  will become either a were creature or a \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere hunter.  A were hunter is one  who has a devine sense  for sniffing out \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere creatures.  Were creatures and were hunters can sense each other, other \r\u003Cbr\u003E\npeople cannot. Were hunters,  unlike the creatures  which they hunt,  do not \r\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiffer in   their abilities  from race to race, they each possess three like \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nskills: Sense Were, Calm were and cleanse were.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Occassionally,  the moon will force  the inner beast of a were creature to \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  emerge,  during this time the  were creature loses all sense of self for a \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n  moment, and may or may not attack a fellow player in the room. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do the were hunter skills do?\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nA were hunter  will always be able to detect the presence of a were creature \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the room, while they may not always be able to sense exactly which person \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas the were gene,  they can often  find out  through process of elimination. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are a nopk were creature, do not worry,  the were hunter can not kill\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou. However,  he can  \u0027calm\u0027 you,  and  put you to sleep  using  his unique \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge  of taming  the were creature.  Once  you  are put to sleep he can \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027cleanse\u0027  you,  causing you to be  one step closer  to being healed of your\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere gene.  the were hunter cannot cleanse you more than once a day. However,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree such  cleanses  will completely  heal you  and you will no longer be a\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwerecreature.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow powerful are detect were and detect hunter?\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe werecreatures ability to sense  they are in danger is much  stronger than \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe  hunters  ability  to sense  who they hunt.  While a hunter  can feel the \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nwerecreatures presense if they are in the same room, a werecreature can sense\r\u003Cbr\u003E\na hunter as soon as he or she enters their realm of existance.  Like the were \r\u003Cbr\u003E\nhunters  however,  a were creature will not  know who is out to  cleanse them,\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly that they are present.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, what were creatures can each race become?\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor this, I have contructed a chart.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B=============================================================================\u002B\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Race      |  Beast          |  Resistances             |  Vulnerabilities   |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B=============================================================================\u002B\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Elf       | Lynx            |  Slash                   |  Pierce            |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Syvin     | Panther         |  Magic                   |  Slash             |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Dwarf     | Wolverine       |  Slash, Bash             |  Pierce, Lightning |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Canthi    | Sea Devil       |  Magic                   |  Fire              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Sidhe     | Condor          |  Pierce                  |  Bash              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Litan     | Dragon          |  Magic                   |  Bash              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Vro\u0027ath   | Boar            |  Magic                   |  Bash              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| Human     | Wolf            |  Magic                   |  Slash             |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n| All       | Were Hunter     |  None                    |  None              |\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u002B=============================================================================\u002B\r\u003Cbr\u003E\nOOC FACTS:\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n** Were Hunters will get a special prize each time they cleanse a were creature.

To learn them, \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   you must have 1 million experience and 1000 gold for each.\r\u003Cbr\u003E\n** The chance to become a werecreature or werehunter is VERY slim. About .05% per level. \r\u003Cbr\u003E\n   If you do get the weregene, you will be notified.
