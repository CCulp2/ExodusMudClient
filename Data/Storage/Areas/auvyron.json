Of course, you didn\u0027t need to know thatthis was evil incarnate.  Perhaps the incense that wafts a smell of old,dried blood across the stifling hot air precludes any thought of redeemingthis man, or reimprisoning him.  Perhaps it is the sight of his \u0060msoul\u0060achained to the lone supporting pillar.  Perhaps it is this man\u0027s eyes,which are mere pits into a \u0060ksulfurous \u0060ihell\u0060a.",
